UPDATE: AITA for threatening to sue my parents for taking out student loans in my name?	6125	dmx2l4	AmItheAsshole	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dmx2l4/update_aita_for_threatening_to_sue_my_parents_for/	376	"https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9ysceh/aita_for_threatening_to_sue_my_parents_for_taking/

This update has a happy ending of sorts. Basically what happened is that I did end up having to make a police report about what happened. My parents weren't arrested but they were charged with deceptive practice. As part of a negotiated deal, they agreed to become responsible for the debt and they received 12 months of court supervision.

The student loan company removed the loans from my name then made it clear they planned on suing my parents and myself. My parents for obvious reasons and myself because I benefited from the crime (my degree). My parents and I spoke to a lawyer who agreed that they probably could come after me for at least some of the debt.

Our lawyer and their in-house counsel came up with a deal that basically said if I paid half myself, they'd forever give up their right to sue me or try to collect the other half from me. I wasn't crazy about the deal but it's cheaper than going to court where I'd likely be found to be jointly liable with my parents for the full ~$25,000 and attorney fees.

I paid my part of it three months ago and it's like I've never had student loans. Nothing on my record at all regarding it. My parents sold the boat for a loss and are making payments on the remainder of the balance. They've apologized to me pretty profusely about it and I do think they are remorseful.

As a cherry on top, my brother told me they opened a credit card in his name around the same time they took out the student loans. He only found out after going to purchase a house and the loan officer asked him about it. That was paid off in full before he found out about it though.

I speak to my parents maybe once a month now, more than in the past and our relationship is still fairly cool but not nearly as bad as what it was. Also, I definitely did not go to Christmas last year, I think I will be going this year though.

**Edit regarding why I may have been found jointly liable** - My parents paid 50% of my rent my senior year of college, I also (unhappily while interviewing) lived with them for half a year after school. They asked for half and wiped it off of my credit forever. It's more than 50% of rent but I was done with it. I have a decently-paying job now and wanted to move on. I did a crappy job of wording it but they sold the boat for ~$9000 (paid to the lender), I paid ~$8000 (a little more than what half of my rent was) and they are making payments on their ~$8000. Apologies for not being more clear.

**Edit 2** Alright maybe I should have gotten a differently lawyer. I just wanted it to go away with no lawsuit. Looking like that was short-sighted. Overall, I'm ok with it. I never paid my parents back for the 50% rent in college, they were just going to let it be, I feel like I've made up for that now.

[Really good advice in this comment](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dmx2l4/update_aita_for_threatening_to_sue_my_parents_for/f55m9xs/) if you're worried about it happening to you. Just don't get a shitty lawyer."	1572037017.0

TIFU by pulling my butt plug off the wall and ripping the entire tile off with it a day before rent inspection. NSFW.	12035	dmvamy	tifu	https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dmvamy/tifu_by_pulling_my_butt_plug_off_the_wall_and/	772	"[here it is ](https://imgur.com/gallery/mJD8PLC)

I wash and stick it to the tiled wall in our bathroom to dry because it‚Äôs handy and it makes me laugh every time I walk into the bathroom. We have a rent inspection tomorrow so I pulled it off the wall to put it away and managed to rip the entire tile off the wall with it. I‚Äôve propped the tile back against the wall as best as I could and have shoved a plant pot in front of it to try and hide it. Worst part is my Dad is a carpenter and I‚Äôm going to ask him to fix it but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to explain how the tile fell off. 

‚ÄúHey Dad I pulled my butt plug off the wall and ripped the entire tile off in the process lmao‚Äù 

TL;DR I pulled my butt plug off the wall and ripped the tile off with it a day before rent inspection.

**Edit** 
I know it‚Äôs an easy fix to put a tile back on the wall, we just attached it back on temporarily - but I want it done properly (sealed and all) so I don‚Äôt lose my bond when my lease is up. Partner isn‚Äôt a tradie. Dad is. Dad costs less than paying someone to come properly fix it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"	1572026801.0

My [31m] mother [59f] opened a credit card in my name and I feel like all trust is broken.	6509	dmvr9z	relationship_advice	https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmvr9z/my_31m_mother_59f_opened_a_credit_card_in_my_name/	357	"I found out about it when I was trying to get a car loan from my credit union. I was at a dealership about 200 miles away (my wife and I live a few minutes from my mother) and found a pretty good deal on a car I was going to be buying in the next month or so anyway. Since I wasn‚Äôt planning on buying it yesterday, I had to call my credit union to get the loan started. A few minutes later, I get a call back asking about a credit card opened in 2017 with nearly a dozen late payments, some as late as 120 days. I obviously have no idea about it and ask the loan officer wtf it was and he gave the address on the account as my mother‚Äôs house. 

After not purchasing the car, I called my mother who confessed to it. She said she just needed a ‚Äúlittle extra spending money‚Äù and I owed $2500 for it. She also said she couldn‚Äôt make the payment every month. My parents‚Äô financial problems were the reason they got a divorce 10 years ago. My dad has always said that while he did love my mother, the main reason why we lived paycheck to paycheck my entire childhood was because of her spending. He finally got tired of it and set some hard limits, she went around his back and started taking credit card advances to make it look like she hadn‚Äôt spent so much. When he caught her, they got divorced.

My mother said it‚Äôs not a big deal but I got denied for a car loan specifically because of it. My wife and I are planning on buying a house in the next year or two. She‚Äôs completely broken my trust and I‚Äôm not sure how to go forward. It‚Äôs not a one time mistake obviously. How do I go forward with my relationship with my mother when she literally did the same thing she did to my dad?"	1572029700.0

You should be able to honestly tell your SO if they have gained weight to the point of you losing physical attraction towards them and you shouldn‚Äôt be labelled as a ‚Äúbad person / a*hole/ etc‚Äù if you do so.	12496	dmv071	unpopularopinion	https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/dmv071/you_should_be_able_to_honestly_tell_your_so_if/	1110	"Sorry if my English is not the best - it's not my mother tongue.

TLDR (finally): You should be able to straightforwardly AND respectfully express to your SO if they gained weight to the point you start losing desire for their body IF you both consider sex  and physical attraction vital for your relationship (while also being totally in love with each other). 

I‚Äôve currently read a post on ask/men about a guy struggling to communicate with his GF about her gaining so much weight she isn‚Äôt desirable for him anymore (physical attraction wise). And booooi, I got so MAD reading most of the comments, starting with those who says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt tell them‚Äù and those who claim to be gentle about it and definitely not be straightforward, instead, hide it behind silly excuses like: ‚ÄúI want to get healthy so let‚Äôs be healthy together‚Äù or just turning it towards yourself as you are responsible in order to make her change.

WHAT.A.BULLSHIT!

Holy crap, I can‚Äôt even!

Are these people serious?

Before anything else, I was / am f\*t (while successfully losing weight, yay\~) and I also had a time when my now-ex told me that sometimes he just couldn‚Äôt get it up because my visuals were just not there (he adored my face, my smile, eyes but he couldn‚Äôt tell it about the other parts of my body). It‚Äôs true that it was one of my most painful experiences and I cried. A LOT. It was hell and I felt so unworthy. BUT

Honesty is NOT kindness. Honesty is honesty. Period. I don‚Äôt mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn‚Äôt put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. You can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. If you can‚Äôt take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. And yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

You can‚Äôt just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

By the way, I think people should be able to discuss it early in a relationship and should be able to come to terms about what they expect from the other: such as giving each other the freedom of honesty by which they can calmly tell each other that they wouldn‚Äôt like the partner to become f\*t because that‚Äôs not what they are attracted to and if they can‚Äôt agree on being considerate and careful with weight gain then they don‚Äôt have to be together.

Your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ‚Äúsoft‚Äù) - and how you react to that is YOUR responsibility. The partner doesn‚Äôt have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it‚Äôs a sensitive topic to you. I wonder why it‚Äôs so sensitive‚Ä¶

So those who still think that ‚Äútelling your SO they‚Äôre f\*t to the point they became unattractive in your eyes‚Äù should be delivered in marshmallow-coating, under comfy blankets of words so their vulnerable self esteem won‚Äôt deteriorate, should seriously reconsider the relationship itself.

And no, the justification of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt tell me to lose weight as you are still eating junk food‚Äù is nowhere near legitimate, only if the said partner has an actually shitty lifestyle and diet and seemingly doesn‚Äôt care if he/she lives another 30 years. But just because your partner doesn‚Äôt gain weight by eating pizza 3x/week or because they don‚Äôt actually work out and only going to work by bike or walking a lot on average while still staying at a healthy weight, that doesn‚Äôt mean you are not responsible for keeping up with sexual preferences that you basically agreed on by starting a relationship with them. The fact your bodies work differently is not for debate at this point. If you are jealous because the other one stays thin with minimal effort, then it tells a lot about you...

It‚Äôs totally okay if you are good with yourself being f\*t but don‚Äôt expect the partner to feel the same way and if they show you their concerns about your weight don‚Äôt go around screaming ‚ÄúASSHOLE‚Äù, just stop and think for a minute and if the state of your body worth more than adjusting it to someone‚Äôs personal preference (and to save the relationship) then you should have a big enough self-esteem to simply walk away. You are not obliged to change just because someone wants you to and they are not obliged to stay just because you have no intention to change. What you are willing to compromise is 100% on you.

If people overall would have a little bit more self love and would be alright a little bit more with being alone (but well in their own company), they would be able to remove people from their lives who don‚Äôt fit in more easily.

Last thought:

If your loved ones can‚Äôt even discuss their serious problems (and yes, in a sexual relationship, physical attraction or the lack of it is one), because you are in an alarming mental state and can‚Äôt cope with this type of (again NOT asshole-level) honesty, you shouldn‚Äôt even be in a relationship as long as you fixed your issues. Stop putting the burden of tiptoeing and overly soft-communication on your partner‚Äôs shoulder. Because being in a state when you have to walk on eggshells around your partner, is a serious sign of failed free-communication.

Looks does matter. We have a right to voice what we like and by putting away our own ego we should be more flexible dealing with and communicating it.

I had my fair share of this honesty as a f\*t girlfriend of someone. He delivered his concerns very honestly with enough amount of kindness - he loved and cared for me but he also valued his own sexual preferences and still to this day I‚Äôm grateful he could open up about it, and I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt an easy thing to tell me. He was indeed a good person. It was hard to hear, it was painful to digest but here I am now having learnt of the situation. And for the record, I‚Äôm also not attracted to f\*t men so I decided to just suck it up and work on myself to have a strong, healthy and lean body so I don‚Äôt have to deal with a shitty double standard regarding my own level of attractiveness and the person‚Äôs I‚Äôm looking for.

Edit: I want to thank you all for your input. I didn't write this post to arrogantly reinforce that I'm 100% right, but this sub is here to engage in conversations about unpopular topics. I think I succeeded in it. Some of your opinions really made me think and I might reevaluate some things I said and I think this is one of the beauties of intelligent debating. I want to stress that I never encouraged anyone to f\*t-shame or to be cruel. I wrote ""straightforward and respectful without being overly kind. Also: f\*t is censored because of bots.

I‚Äôve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won‚Äôt Stop Crying [Part 3]	1801	dmyq8g	nosleep	https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dmyq8g/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the/	82	"[Read Part 1 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dlk100/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the/?st=k269q0gn&sh=f6440917)

[Read Part 2 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dm86h5/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the/?st=k269q1qh&sh=b655a8d9)

After another dozen hours or so, I opened the bathroom door. The lights in the cabin were back to normal and I couldn‚Äôt smell any sulfur. 

I cautiously made my way back to my seat and almost cried when the grinning crying flight attendant came by offering a meal. That crappy airline food was the most delicious thing I‚Äôd ever eaten. 

When I‚Äôd finished, my mind immediately turned to Mary. What had happened to her?

I crept down the aisle towards first class, trying to keep a low profile. Surprisingly, the flight attendants were nowhere to be seen. They‚Äôd almost seemed to ignore me, almost as if they wanted me to find her.

She had a row to herself and was staring down at her phone in the window seat. I slid into the aisle and shook her arm. 

‚ÄúMary!‚Äù I hissed.

She pulled out her headphones and stared at me with a surprised expression. ‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat did that thing do to you? What did they do to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, remind me how I know you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? We just-‚Äù I realized with sinking horror that she had no idea who I was. I fought back tears. ‚ÄúMary, how long have you been on this flight?‚Äù

She checked the watch on her wrist. ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs 4:03 AM so a few hours at least.‚Äù She stared at me the same way you‚Äôd look at a person claiming they were the second coming of Christ. Her tone was low and reassuring. ‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt worry so much. Look on the bright side; we‚Äôll be landing in about an hour.‚Äù

I felt an iron grip on my arm and looked up to see two flight attendants. ‚ÄúSir, this area is for first-class passengers only.‚Äù 

They were still crying and grinning, but just with tears this time. I could still see streaks of blood staining the front of their uniforms though. 

I was escorted back to my seat where I spent the next several days. Attendants continued to stop by with food, I would use the bathroom, and soon was going absolutely crazy with the monotony. 

In retrospect, those few days weren‚Äôt so bad. There‚Äôs a lot of content on the internet after all, even with crappy plane WiFi. No, it didn‚Äôt get really bad until around ten days later when the WiFi failed.

It was sometime a week later that I lost control and began screaming for a flight attendant. They didn‚Äôt come for several minutes, but eventually one did.

‚ÄúJust...just let me see the Captain,‚Äù I asked.

The flight attendant bent low and spoke with that same customer-service voice: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sir, the captain has made his decision regarding you quite clear. You didn‚Äôt answer his call, and will, therefore, wait.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù

‚ÄúQuite a while I‚Äôm afraid. Don‚Äôt worry though sir, we‚Äôll be landing in about an hour.‚Äù She straightened and walked away.

I started making notches on various parts of the seatback to keep track of different things. One notch for each time I used the bathroom, one for each meal, one for every time I watched Thor Ragnarok, that sort of thing. 

It was hell. I watched every movie in the seatback a dozen times over. If I ever acted out badly enough, I would be escorted back to my seat by one or more flight attendants. Any attempt at conversation with other passengers was met with confusion by them followed by a quick escort back to my seat.

I‚Äôd guess it was on or around day thirty that, in a moment of panic and psychosis, I broke my laptop and phone, screaming at the top of my lungs. No one around me reacted in any way. 

Two months later, I stunk. The muscles in my legs were tight and cramped constantly. I finally concluded that suicide was my only option after my hundred-and-twenty-eight rewatch of Thor Ragnarok. 

I got to my feet and limped towards the emergency exit. I knew normally the pressure inside the airplane forced the doors closed, but I figured that nothing about my situation was normal. If this didn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôd find some other more painful way to go. 

I grabbed at the handle and swung it up. To my shock, the door opened easily, though no wind of any kind whipped around the cabin. It remained the standard slightly-too-cold temperature that it‚Äôd been for the past who-knew how long. 

The open door called to me, a black portal out of the plane. I stared at it for a long moment, almost too long. An attendant‚Äôs hand grabbed my shoulder, pulling me away. In a fit of anger and strength that surprised me, I wrenched away and jumped out of the plane. 

The wind whipping past my face was almost magical, a new sensation after so many months of the same. The ocean below me grew closer and larger, and I realized that suddenly, I didn‚Äôt want to die after all. 

It grew larger and larger and larger until it seemed that all I could see was darkness and waves.

I impacted the surface of the water so fast and hard that my entire body jerked around in the seat. I pulled my hand back, sucking at my bruised knuckle. I‚Äôd hit it on the seat in front of me.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered. Then shouted. ‚ÄúNO! NO! NO!‚Äù

A flight attendant ran down the aisle, kneeling beside me. ‚ÄúAre you OK sir?‚Äù

I clenched my hands into fists, almost swinging at her. But then I realized. 

She wasn‚Äôt grinning.

She wasn‚Äôt crying. 

To be honest she looked a little scared of me.

I reached my right hand down to my pocket where I could feel my now-unbroken phone. 

4:04 AM.

‚ÄúSir, if you can calm down we‚Äôll be landing in about an hour.‚Äù

My mouth tasted like ash. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I managed. ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù

I stared unblinking at my phone. It now displayed 4:05 AM.

Then I looked out my window and began to cry at the sight of city lights below me. 

We did land in about an hour. I can‚Äôt even begin to explain why or how, but I‚Äôm currently sitting in an airport cafe typing this out. I‚Äôm free. I‚Äôm out.

And I‚Äôm never going flying again.

EDIT: I sure hope the bartender here at the airport just has a naturally wide grin.

"""Sorry boss, I don't speak spanish"""	9859	dmtvik	MaliciousCompliance	https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/dmtvik/sorry_boss_i_dont_speak_spanish/	261	"I work at a hotel as a night auditor, and this malicious compliance begins with a small bit of information I was told when I was initially hired for this position. When I interviewed for the position, and this is very important later on, I was told by the HR lady that the hotel paid a bonus ($100) for each foreign language I spoke well enough to serve our guests. Management cleared my $100 for speaking english after I passed through their evaluation period (my main language is portuguese).

At first, I was glad to be working in the night shift, mostly because my colleague then, Mr. Castillo was from Guatemala, so whenever any guests that spoke spanis showed up, he handled it and in turn, I handled any english speaking foreigners. Naturally, he did a lot more work since the amount of spanish speaking guests we receive is significantly larger than our english speaking ones. Meanwhile, Mr. Castillo was in the process of learning english and I had taken an interest in spanish so we helped each other out.

Not long after, Mr. Castillo got himself a job paying several times over what the hotel did and sadly, left me. My new colleague, a newly promoted bellboy didn't speak english (though he could understand some) and didn't speak spanish at all. In fact, he didn't even try to improve any of his language skills while I slowly kept improving my spanish, trying to use more and more of it everyday to serve our dear guests. As of the start of this month, I spoke to our frontdesk manager and asked him in plain spanish, what did I have to do exactly to receive the $100 bonus for speaking spanish. He was surprised but said nothing more since the front desk got busy with check-outs and my shift was up, but a few days later he mentioned he spoke to HR and informed them I was speaking spanish well enough to receive my bonus, and now he was just waiting to hear back from them.

A few days later, the HR lady asked me what size shirt I wore since they were going to be ordering new uniforms in the coming weeks, and took the opportunity to ask her about my bonus for spanish and she mentioned they were talking with our director about it. A day later she informed me they wouldn't be paying me the bonus for a foreign language since it was on file that I was already receiving it. I replied I was receiving a bonus for english, not spanish and she said she would speak to the director again and within a few days, all would be made well. Now I'm not really in a hurry to get my bonus, but it would be nice if they had cleared it already, as it would show up in my next paycheck, but guess what? They didn't. Our director talked to HR again, and my boss and told them that, even though I am serving our dear spanish speaking guests, in spanish, I don't in fact, speak spanish.

I'm far from fluent, but I can explain how the hotel works, direct guests to where they need to be and assist them with what they need, be it finding a pharmacy at 3am, getting a cab to go out and get drinks, or even hire an escort (yep), but apparently it isn't good enough for our director and my manager said he can't really afford to fight him on it. Okay, no biggie I guess, maybe we'll try again next year when I can speak a little better I thought. However, the cruel and unforgiving gods of the hotel industry gave me the perfect opportunity to strike back...

Earlier last week we received a large group of 30+ spanish speaking tourists, which in addition to our normal occupancy, meant we were effectively sold out for the week. Big groups are usually a minor incovenience when you're checking them in, but an even bigger problem when checking them out. Especially if they're 1 person per room, which means you basically have a huge load of rooms to check-out, one by one, while an endless line forms in front of the front desk. 80+ checkouts aren't unsual for our hotel on friday mornings, but 110+ is a problem. Normally when the morning shift has a workload this big, our front desk manager comes in early to help, but he couldn't this time since he took a personal day since his mother fell ill. That left our director with only one choice, to ask the night audit to stay late and help until our reservations people clocked in and could then replace us at the front desk.

See, my colleague doesn't like staying late, especially since he works at a second job with his father in the afternoon, meaning he only has the morning and early afternoon to sleep. I don't like staying late on fridays because of the amount of check-outs, which means it'll be forever before you can take a breath and even more so before you can leave. However this time our director didn't even ask my colleague and instead told me to stay late because we would have a sizeable workload and about a third of it would require someone that spoke spanish, or it would slow down everything to a crawl. I told him I would not be staying late that morning and before I could get another word him, he started yammering about how I'm wrong and I should be more of a teamplayer and the he would be very grateful for it. Wanting to get back to my sleep, I told him to ask my colleague and he said he couldn't, that they needed me and when I asked him why, he clearly stated ""We need 2 spanish speakers that morning to make sure everything goes OK with the checkouts."" Not one for missing an opportunity to get payback, I replied ""Sorry boss, I don't speak spanish"", turned off my phone and went back to sleep.

UPDATE: Sorry for holding out on the aftermath. I wrote this during my shift and as I was putting on the finishing touches, we had a server crash and I spent the next hour and a half trying to restore our backups and get the camera system up again.

UPDATE - Aftermath: After I woke up and turned my cellphone back on, I had several missing calls from the hotel and two missing calls from our frontdesk manager (good guy). I called back the hotel but the afternoon shift picked up and they didn't know anything so I called my manager's phone. He answered and asked me what was going on because the director was furious about me ""hanging up on him"" and that I was ""refusing to work"". I explained to him the situation in regards to my bonus for speaking spanish, and since the hotel was trying to hold out on me, I was going to withhold performance. Anyone who's ever worked costumer service know how much damage withholding performance can do, even if it just a little. In the end, my manager begged me to stay until our reservations people came in at 8AM (my shift ends at 07:20AM). I agreed on the condition that I would not check out anyone who spoke spanish. He reluctantly accepeted and said he would back me up in the following shitstorm that would happen.

What happened was that the group came down for breakfast precisely at 6:40AM, finished at 07:10AM give or take and went back to their room to collect their belongings. At this time, the two front desk attendants of the morning shift had arrived, as well as our bellboy, plus, there was me and my colleague waiting to punch out and go. We had already started checking people out and this day was particularly busy, we had 3 or 4 people waiting to be checked out, and it doesn't help that we only have 3 computers for 4 people to work with, with another computer for us to check the cameras. When 07:20AM came up, my colleague quickly picked up his things and left and I took over his spot. At this time the first few people in the group started coming down and they already had to wait since we were all checking out other people. A few minutes later I got the first one but I told them I couldn't check them out since I don't speak spanish and asked them to wait for my colleagues to become available. In the end I ended up refusing service to 10 or so people, which started forming a line right in front of the front desk, which only grew since other guests assumed they were all in line to be checked out. My colleagues on the morning shift were not happy at all, the guests were less than satisfied, and when the first of our reservations people showed up at 8AM, I logged out, punched out and went home. By that time, there was a 20+ line of people waiting to be checked out by 2 overworked recepcionists, only one of which spoke spanish.

In the ensuing shitstorm that happened, the hotel's director arrived at 8:30AM in an attempt to minimize the anger of the human centipede who formed in the front desk, started chatted with the guests and otherwise trying to distract them so they would be less angry and avoid giving the hotel a poor review. I got a mild chewing out by my manager for ""poor work ethic"" instead of being written up. True to his word, he backed me up when the director called him and HR for a meeting regarding my actions (you can't demand someone speak a language that you know they don't right?). I still haven't got my bonus for speaking spanish, and I let my manager know that I will not be speaking any spanish while on the job until they give in and give me my hard earned bonus."	1572016887.0

I think I've been shadow banned for saying MtF's can‚Äôt have a period.	2010	dmxfnq	TrueOffMyChest	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dmxfnq/i_think_ive_been_shadow_banned_for_saying_mtfs/	526	"I signed up a few days ago and I started to post on a regional sub but something seemed off. I checked and discovered that I have been shadow banned even before I submitted my first post. I only had two other posts before I posted to that sub. One is in Legal Advice asking about my neighbours dogs barking and the other was this below that I posted to a thread about Jessica Yaniv claiming to have period cravings. 

  

>It's someone pretending to have a biological function they can't have and they're being put right. Periods cause humiliation in a lot of cultures, period sufferers are refused tampons and pads in holding cells, endometriosis causes insufferable pain, people die in period huts. I got laughed out of class for having period stains on my PE kit. This person doesn't have a period. You shouldn't appropriate the suffering of others, it's offensive. Then again that's what this character is all about, being an offensive caricature of the Trans community. The damage they've done over the years is incalculable.

  

I don't think this is about the dogs. 

 

I'm bloody sickened that you can't even have an opinion about this without being sneakingly banned.

For the record I have no issue with Tran's people. I don't deny that HRT might cause hormonal cravings. *But MtF's don't have periods.* 

I have been though cervical cancer and a brutal rape, both of which made me bleed profusely and every time I have my period, I am retraumatised by it, this is why I'm so sensitive about it. Periods are fucking awful. No woman actually wants them. It's something we suffer through. Trans women suffer through other things that a cis woman doesn't, I would never take that away from them.

And stop with the nicknames, FART, TERF. It's a bully's tactic to silence people. Have a civil conversation and you might find there's a traumatised woman who's sensitive to anyone encroaching on an issue women have spent thousands of years trying to deal with. 

May as well reset the router, get a new account and start all over again, all the social justice warriors hiding behind a mod curtain are now going to ban me."	1572038793.0

We had a small wedding and a big evening reception for extended family and friends at a local hotel, as a thank you for my mother and newly minted mother in law, we bought them bouquets and the staff hid them in the bar stock room until we were ready for them. 

I got changed out of my dress and into something I could have fun in after the traditional first dance and dancing with my dad, things were going well I met a lot of new family members, the time came to get the flowers, the staff were busy but said I could walk behind the bar and get them myself. As I was headed to the store room, a man shouted "" excuse me."" I thought this was for the bar staff because I don't work here.
Man. Where do you think you are going?
Me. Oh, to get the flowers.
Man. Well that can wait, I want.. Stuff I can't remember.
Me. Oh, sorry I can't do that, I ..
Man. Why can't you just serve me I've been here for ages.
Me. I don't work here I'm the bride, and you are?
Man went quiet and red in the face, turns out he worked in the same place as my husband and had tagged along with a group who actually were invited. But despite that it was a wonderful day and we can still laugh together after 28 years."	1572036119.0

My toddlers grandmother stealing his identity?	1606	dmxcbm	legaladvice	https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dmxcbm/my_toddlers_grandmother_stealing_his_identity/	78	"Just to give a little back story I have a son who is a year and half old. Me and his mother are no longer together but he lives with me now. Before he lived with me about 4 months ago, he was living in Florida with his mother and her mom. 

Her mother is notorious for stealing her children's identities, opening credit cards, putting bills in their names. Stuff like that. So it occurred to me that I dont have his social security number card. I asked his mother if she took it to Florida with her and she told me her mother stole it from her. 
Obviously this is a concern to me. I thought maybe I could check his credit on credit karma or something to see if shes used it yet but he isn't old enough for me to check that way. 

Is there a way for me to check if shes using his ssn? If not is there some way I can preemptively report her for stealing his identity even if I'm not sure that shes used it yet?

If it's important, I know that she has a warrant out for her arrest for violating probation in North Carolina, thats why she moved to Florida."	1572038333.0

My jobs include serving customers by packaging what they want into boxes, stocking the showcase with pastries, cakes, cookies, etc, and occasionally helping in the kitchen.

Like any other bakery that does everything by hand, it's not easy to make everything a uniform shape and size for each product. When a customer comes in who is very obese or overweight, I low-key dig around for the smallest of the item that they want, such as the smallest cookies, fritter or donut. In my head I'm thinking, ""they don't need this, they're sick and could use a little less calories. They shouldn't be in here, I'll help them out by giving them a little less"". When really it isn't my responsibility and if they want something sweet that may not be very good for their already bad condition..then whatever I shouldn't hinder something that's going to make them very happy.

I can't say that I will likely stop doing it after confessing..I just still feel like if I don't try and do the little thing to help them, who will?"	1572035572.0

Bethesda, this subreddit has been a beacon of positivity amid rabid criticism of your game. Its vocal anger should make you very, very afraid for the future of FO76.	3740	dmu8qn	fo76	https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmu8qn/bethesda_this_subreddit_has_been_a_beacon_of/	481	"This sub has been a wonderful community. While much of the Fallout fandom jumped ship on 76 almost immediately amid an admittedly shaky release and follow-through, this subreddit has stuck it out.

The sub got new people into the game, shared tips on how to make the scene more accessible to new players when the game was made free for a weekend, etc.

To see a community that has always been so positive and helpful turn on Bethesda so quickly and so openly‚Äî this should be a very big sign. This isn‚Äôt a group of people who have been on the fence about Fallout 76‚Äì most of this sub fucking loves the game.

Bethesda, pay very close attention to this reaction. Your most positive, happy fans have turned on you almost immediately. Is this really the group of patrons that you want to ostracize? 

Honestly, Bethesda should think very carefully about going down this path.

EDIT: There‚Äôs been a bunch of comments about how this subreddit was never really a positive one. I think I‚Äôll walk back my original statement; compared to the General fallout subreddit, this one has been largely positive."	1572019504.0

It's Official! 37 years after Byron Preiss buried his treasures across the United States, a 3rd key from The Secret has been found in Boston.	781	dmz5st	UnresolvedMysteries	https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/dmz5st/its_official_37_years_after_byron_preiss_buried/	45	"[Just in from the Boston Globe!](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/10/25/hidden-treasure-family-quest-and-the-secret/RkYsVbk5DoSD6ReMCN9JJJ/story.html?fbclid=IwAR0TD2z0FRRpoqgQvXrgCAIFhImP_9FgVaPgcEtBGm-EcJgApDwKdEDZaiQ) Jason Krupat, a fan of Byron Priess's The Secret, believed he'd cracked the puzzle and traced the Boston key to ~~a park near Fenway~~  Langone Park in the North End. When he saw a construction crew gathered to dig up the baseball field, he went over and told them about the story and asked them to look out for buried treasure. The rest is now history.

Published in 1982, The Secret contains 12 paintings and poems that lead readers to the locations of 12 buried keys. Each key can be exchanged for a real gem. Last week, Byron's widow, Sandi Mendelson, presented Jason with the gem. [There are still 9 out there waiting to be discovered!](https://boingboing.net/2014/07/15/the-quest-to-find-12-hidden-tr.html)

The other two keys were discovered in Chicago (1983) and Cleveland (2004). Josh Gates, from Expedition Unknown, was present for the unearthing of part of the casque and key, which had been damaged by the excavator. A special episode of Gates's show will run Wednesday next week."	1572046661.0

Bolton reportedly in talks to testify to the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry	591	dmzwjp	Keep_Track	https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/dmzwjp/bolton_reportedly_in_talks_to_testify_to_the/	35	"CNN [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/25/politics/john-bolton-lawyers-impeachment-inquiry/index.html) that lawyers for former national security adviser John Bolton have had talks with the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry about a possible closed-door deposition.

[Democrats on the committes have said](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-inquiry-10-22-2019/h_f80f66208be400c534656f010c47d444) they believe his testimony is needed.

Multiple witnesses have testified that Bolton -- who was ousted from the White House last month -- expressed [open contempt](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/bolton-silence-hangs-over-impeachment-inquiry-as-threat-to-trump) for efforts to seek politically motivated investigations from Ukraine that are now the heart of the House investigation.

In one pivotal incident described by both Taylor and former National Security Council aide Fiona Hill, an irritated Bolton abruptly ended a July 10 White House meeting with a representative of Ukraine‚Äôs government after Trump‚Äôs ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, ‚Äúconnected ‚Äòinvestigations‚Äô with an Oval Office meeting‚Äù sought by Ukraine‚Äôs new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

# Giuliani a ""Hand grenade""; rogue op like a ""drug deal""

**Fiona Hill**, Trump's former top Russia adviser, [told lawmakers ](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/14/politics/who-is-fiona-hill/index.html) she saw ""wrongdoing"" in American foreign policy and Bolton encouraged her to report it to the National Security Council's attorney. A source told CNN Hill testified that Bolton referred to Giuliani as a ""hand grenade,"" who was ""going to blow everybody up"" and that Bolton characterized a rogue operation led by US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and WH acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as being like a ""drug deal"".

**Bill Taylor,** former US diplomat to Ukraine,  told Congress in his [opening statement](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/bill-taylor-opening-statement-congress/index.html)  that Bolton had expressed concern about the July call between Trump and  Zelensky and said Trump was pressing for Ukraine to  publicly announce investigations into the Bidens before he would  greenlight US security assistance and a White House meeting with  Zelensky.

# Upcoming: first testimony from a currently employed WH official

[**Tim Morrison**,](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/24/politics/white-house-official-impeachment-inquiry-testimony/index.html)  a top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council, had listened to the Trump-Zelensky call and informed Taylor about the conversation. 

Morrison's upcoming testimony before the House next week will be the first from  someone who **directly heard the call**, and the first from a currently employed WH official."	1572049787.0

This has been going on saying he will buy a new game and then proceed not to because he knows how much I like buying games digitally and I will end up getting it.

It's not that he doesn't have the money buying microtransactions in all of his other games and won't spend anything on a new title for both of us.

So today the new call of duty comes out and he is super hyped for it saying he has no cash but can't wait to play it.

So instead of digitally buying I went to the store and bought it."	1572022515.0

I work with a doctor who is wild about sweets and loves food (healthily). I think I found out why tonight and it nearly made me shed a tear.	6082	dmscvn	CasualConversation	https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/dmscvn/i_work_with_a_doctor_who_is_wild_about_sweets_and/	126	"I‚Äôm a nurse and I work in the recovery room area, so I have frequent communication with the anesthesiologists and we all often share food and treats amongst ourselves. One particular doctor will nearly bust down a door if he hears there‚Äôs something sweet or tasty to be eaten. He heard there was cake in our meeting today and he came in and grabbed a slice. One of the other anesthesiologists who was giving us a presentation jokingly called him out on walking into our meeting just to grab some cake. We all laughed and went about our meeting.

Later one of my coworkers asked the food-loving anesthesiologist if he‚Äôs always had a sweet tooth, and he said to us, ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôve pretty much always been like this, when I was little I spent a lot of time climbing the counters just to eat spoon fulls of sugar because we weren‚Äôt very well off and that‚Äôs all we had for something sweet when I was a kid. And this one time I found what I thought were a bunch of chocolates in the cupboard, but it was actually bakers chocolate and it was terrible.‚Äù 

This anesthesiologist is always the one who buys us a smorgasbord of pizza, pasta, and deserts on the weekends. He occasionally even bakes adorable cakes for us to eat too. Thinking of this smart, humorous, (now) very well-off person as once being someone who had to eat spoonfuls of sugar just to have a taste of something sweet made me feel so sad. To him this was a very off-hand, nonchalant conversation that he has probably already forgotten about, but to me it meant a lot more. It especially reminded me not to judge the kid who may want to grab some extra candy this Halloween."	1572007091.0

tour manager thinks he knows better than the technical staff for a big name comedian, probably cost his job...	710	dmxs3l	ProRevenge	https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/dmxs3l/tour_manager_thinks_he_knows_better_than_the/	55	"So this happened quite a few years ago. I used to work as a senior technician for a large entertainment venue (around 2000 standing capacity). Most of the time we would have private events etc, but this particular day a very well known comedian was booked to do an hour at the venue. 

Before the show I was expected to meet with his tour manager, discuss his needs, set up stuff etc. He arrives and immediately sets the tone. Personally I think they thought they were ""too big"" to play our venue, but they clearly didn't know what they got into.

""Dave wont use any of your crappy mics, he tours with his own sound system"" 

""Sure, when is it getting here""

""I've got it with me"" the manager said in the most condescending tone ever. He proceeded to pull out a self contained speaker system, no bigger than a suitcase.  There was no way it was going to fill the first two rows of tables, never mind the rest of the venue, which would be at capacity that night. 

""No problem, I can give you a tie line so you can use our speakers""

""That's not acceptable. Dave will only use our speakers and mic.""

To cut a long story short, I spent about 15 minutes arguing with the guy who was belligerent and refused to acknowledge that his crappy system on its own wouldn't fill the venue, and there was no way I could let them do it, without support from us. I explained he would have full control over the sound, my gear was there just to amplify it, I wouldn't need to touch the desk. This still wasnt good enough for him and he threatened to pull Dave from the show.

(Edit for clartity: he was very aggressive and condescending. At a few points he tried to claim I didn't know what I was doing, and that I shouldn't be employed by the company as I was clueless - no matter how much I explained the science etc. He tried to scare me into doing what he wanted by threatening to pull the show - there was no need for this, it was him being stubborn and trying to pull power thinking I would back down and let him cause serious complaints for the venue because of his poor tech knowledge)

He eventually backed down when I told him fine, I'd call the venue manager and explain the situation, I'd get a night off and he wouldn't get paid. Much rather that then hundreds of complaints and refunds. He backed down and we set up for the show. But he was still a jerk and the act was no better. They clearly thought they were better than us and it showed. The act even walked around backstage in his boxers into different peoples dressing rooms without knocking etc. Between them they both managed to annoy everyone. I had enough.

The tour manager had set up a little sound desk at the side of the stage for him to use for ""Dave's"" microphone. He was standing their throughout the show ""mixing his mic"". Where he put himself meant he couldn't hear how it sounded, but could be seen by everyone. My lighting OP and I were at the back of the room a few hundred feet away and hatched our plan. 

The first few minutes of the show were fine until the tour manager moved away from his desk to listen. As he walked away for some strange reason Dave's mic would feedback. He would run back to the desk, try to correct it, but it would solve itself. A couple of minutes later he would walk away and it would start to get that horrible feedback again. Nothing that the audience would notice too much, but Dave and his tour manager certainly did. 

The tour manager was puzzled. He couldn't understand why this was happening and Dave was getting more and more irate, glaring at his manager throughout the act. What they didn't know was that I was watching the manager, and every time he stepped away I turned up the high frequencies on my desk causing the feedback. As he got to the desk I would correct it and get rid of the feedback myself. Rinse and repeat. 

He got so annoyed he came to the back of the venue, barged into our control box and looked at my desk, which of course was set naturally as we had discussed. 

""Have you touched your desk?""

""No mate... actually I did once. Seemed like you were struggling with feedback so I took a bit of the top out.""

He walked away sheepishly back to his desk, about halfway there the mic started feeding back again, this time quite aggressively. He had to run the last 50 foot or so which only drew more attention to him, especially from Dave the comedian.

On his way out the venue I heard the tour manager being chewed out by Dave, about how incompetent he was. 

Few years later I meet Dave at another venue I'm working at. Turns out hes a decent enough guy. Didn't mention the revenge I did on the tour manager, but told him about the gig. Turns out it was one of the last times he used that manager, one of the reasons being how bad that gig was...

TL:DR tour manager thinks he can berate staff and talk down to them, so crew cause feedback during the show so it makes the manager look bad. Turns out to be one of the reasons why he loses a job."	1572040467.0

But a guy and me really hit it off and holy fuck

Just a few highlights: 

1. I woke up in the morning and he was holding me from behind, he pulled around and kissed my head

2. He got over to my place after work and he tackled me

3. He leans his head on me while we are on the couch watching movies

4. I was playing counterstrike and he grabbed me from behind and teased me

5.He sends me stupid little messages throughout the day. Sometimes it's his butt but not always

6.pretty much any time I'm lying down and he will lie on top of me. 

Honestly it just makes every day so much better. It is worth working on yourself but I'm now starting to understand the people who rush back into relationships. That intimacy (when genuine) is addicting"	1572043691.0

(Guilt tripping, saying she adopted me so I owe her my lifetime, etc.) I am an only child so, naturally, this obligation fell on me. However, she comes with debts. About 50k of dollars in debt. I have to take care of her, of my grandmother, of my uncle, and of my adopted father, plus her debt. Therefore, in her mind, she cannot afford to have me running loose, away from her.

A little more background: I met my partner long way back. We were dating for 2 years then I got pregnant. He's a very responsible man so he would take care of the situation. We did not talk about marriage. We didn't want to get married, but seeing as it's the only way to give our child the best set of security and future; we married and I moved to his country.

Yes, I was gonna leave my mother, and all the responsibilities she pushed on me, behind.

The story: I was already 5 months pregnant when I had to travel across the continent to the other side of it. My partner and I bought my plane tickets, but my adopted mother wanted to come with. My partner didn't mind because he didn't know her so well and maybe she should meet his family too. I complied as long as everyone is comfortable. My mother travelled with me on the plane. I was 5 months pregnant, had bleeding issue, and yet, she told me to carry all the things. Great. I originally sat at the aisle seat in the plane. My partner planned this out so I would have easiest access to the bathroom. My mother got cranky about it, asking us to switch, and so I said fine because I didn't want to get anymore upset. Once arrived, she didn't do shit. I had to get the luggages myself. The doctor advised me against doing heavy lifting. My mum just sped up her way to hug and kiss my partner's cheek who was waiting at the exit. But these are all irreverent to the story. I just had to write these out because I am still annoyed with her for the stupid crap.

The TRUE story: Three days in of staying with my partner's mother (this was around Christmas time), my mother would put ketchup and mustard on everything my mother in law made. My partner and I, including his siblings, thought this was super rude, but my mother didn't think so. She thought the food was bad. I, however, thought the food was amazing. These would cost us easily $89 if we got them at the store, but oh no, my mum just had to ruin them with ketchup and mustard.

\*Sidenote: My mother usually doesn't do this, putting condiments on food had never happened before, and the ketchup/mustard would end up on the 95% of the food.

The kicker of it all? P - partner, MIL - mother in law, Me - Me, EM - my mother

P: Hey, uh, I just want to let you know that your mum had been saying some weird shit.  
Me: Okay... ?   
P: Yeah... I don't know how she's comfortable saying all these things to my family.  
Me: Well, what has she been saying?  
P: In a nutshell, she told my mother that you're an unstable emotionally, you're an apathetic psychopath who's feared by everyone in your household, and that you've been abusive towards her.  
Me: ...

That was when I was waking up. So once I took a thoughtful shower, got dressed, I went to ask my mother in law about it.

Me: Is it true that my mother had been saying some weird stuff to you?  
MIL: Yeah, I... The things she said I know they aren't true at all. I knew you since you started dating my kid. You're nothing but a nice and kind girl.  
Me: *starts sobbing* Thank you for not believing her.  
MIL: I would never ever believe her, CapitalReplacement0. I know you. Don't you worry. She's not a real mother at all.

So, after confirming this with my brother in law as well, I went asking my mother about it.

Me: I heard you've been saying weird things.  
EM: I have absolutely no clue what you're on about.  
Me: Don't lie. They all told the same story. Stop ruining my life already.  
EM: I'm not! I just wanna see if they can love you like I do!   
Me: Very bullshit. I know you ruined my others' relationships as well.  
EM: *looks at me with shock in her eyes*

I swear her face went pale. She didn't think I would know. The truth was I asked my ex's friend about why he just left. He explained that my mum was saying all these things and they scared him away.

But in this relationship, I was pregnant. I moved to his country for the baby's sake of a great future. Were she to be living with just me and my mother's 50k debt? I doubt she'd seriously have a good life.

And my mother was willing to ruin the baby's chances at life just because she was petty about not getting a foreigner of a husband herself and that she had to find a way to get rid of her debt that I did not contribute at all.

Me: Stop going around telling people that I'm crazy. They obviously know me better than you do. Stop bragging about your earnings just to ""afford"" me, and stop ruining my MIL's food with ketchup and mustard. That's rude and very low.   
EM: But the food is bad! Am I supposed to be putting up with that?   
Me: No, but you can leave. I know it'd make my pregnancy easier if you'd just leave.

Then she just screamed at me.

I went down to my partner instead. She came at me and we fought. My partner sat there holding my hand. Once everything was done, I did not talk to her or let her be anywhere near my pregnant belly at all.

She even had the audacity to tell my mother in law that my partner and I were fighting, on a verge of breaking up, and that she mediated it all. . There are many more shit my mother had done.  But this one truly pissed me off because she was willing to ruin a child's future just because?

That's truly sick and disgusting.

(After she left, she kept sending my partner messages, telling him how handsome he is, how kind he is for taking care of my psychotic ass, and she reminded him how crazy I am, using out fight as an example.)

TL;DR My adopted mother told my family-in-law that I was a psycho so she could keep me to pay off her debt."	1572013574.0

Rejected after 6th date	869	dmwgb5	dating_advice	https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/dmwgb5/rejected_after_6th_date/	218	"Sucks but I felt she was pulling away slowly and even at dinner this last date I tried to reach for her hand but she wouldn't reciprocate. And I felt like she was giving mixed signals so after dinner I brought up the ""what are you looking for?"" Talk. 

She basically said ""it's me not you"" and that she is hard to open up to people and that when she gets close to having something she freaks out a bit and doesn't want it anymore and gets confused. It sucks cause this was the 6th date and I liked her. But she was scared to bring this up to me and hoping it would change so instead of communicating I just witnessed mixed signals and got anxious. She said I'm a great guy and I'll find someone but they all say that. I'm a bit bitter right now.

I'm glad I know what's going on but man does it suck. I really thought this was gonna go somewhere. First 3 dates were amazing but then something switched. I guess you can't be too optimistic in the beginning. She felt like such a good match for me too (pretty, intelligent, similar background, similar yet different enough, good job) and I thought she liked me. Well I'm proud I made it to 6 dates at least. How does one keep moving forward? I actually legit feel sad cause I've been talking to her for a few months and I felt this took a lot out of me

EDIT: Did not expect this post to get this much attention. Thank you all for the advice and i will keep moving forward and work on myself"	1572033730.0

AITA for asking for the gift receipt to return offensive baby clothes?	18716	dmrko9	AmItheAsshole	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dmrko9/aita_for_asking_for_the_gift_receipt_to_return/	3369	"Yesterday we had a baby shower. Long story short, one of our family friends thought it would be funny to get some baby onesies with offensive things written on them. For example: 

* ""All daddy wanted was a blow job"" 
* ""I'm with the milf"" 
* ""To-do list: Eat, poop, suck some titties"" 

There were like 2 more but I don't remember what they said. When I opened the gift I was humiliated, I thought it was really inappropriate. Before people on here give me shit about not being able to take a joke, I just didn't really think this was the funniest ""joke."" I was mad about the gift because as I was opening and before I could read what they said, I unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. Some people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda surprised. Anyhow, at the end of the party, I asked the person who gave it to me if I could have the gift receipt to return them. I said I definitely wouldn't put my baby in those clothes. The person basically called me oversensitive and said I needed to take a joke. I handed the gift bag back to them and said ""Alright, well then you can keep these."" They were super offended by that and thought it was an ungrateful gesture. AITA?"	1572002722.0

How About Rewarding Ascendant Shards for Raid Completion and Prisms for Encounters	1086	dmwu35	DestinyTheGame	https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dmwu35/how_about_rewarding_ascendant_shards_for_raid/	117	"So, we all know that the raids only give legendary gear as a reward (other than GoS), which doesn't exactly promote playing the older raids except for raid gear for their 2.0 versions. How about adding prisms for each encounter and a shard for completing a raid. I wouldn't make it farm-able each time, otherwise people would only do the quickest raids, but once per week per character would be fair. This would add another source for getting prisms and shards while still having the nightfall being the farm-able method. It may even encourage veteran D2 players to help the new light players get through the older raids.

If that sounds like it is too rewarding and would make the nightfall useless because of guaranteed prisms and shards from raids, then maybe have a featured raid or 2 per week with the rewards.

I just want to be able to do the old raids for fun, but still be able to progress in some way by doing them. As it stands, master-working just one set of armor for 1 character is extremely expensive or requires a massive time investment. And if you masterwork 1 piece and then get a better piece, or want to have different builds, you are either out of luck or Destiny is you job."	1572035754.0

IM THE ONE WHO MESSAGED KAITLYN BRISTOWE	821	dmw6ch	thebachelor	https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/dmw6ch/im_the_one_who_messaged_kaitlyn_bristowe/	264	"Hi, IM THE GIRL BEHIND THE INSTAGRAM POST WITH KAITLYN BRISTOWE. Did my all caps get your attention? I hope so, because that‚Äôs what I was shooting for. Here‚Äôs the deal: I am not a troll or a bully. I don‚Äôt have a Twitter and I just found out what Reddit was 24 hours ago. I‚Äôve been a OTV podcast listener since day 1, a member of the scrunchie gang, and considered myself a KB supporter. I have a little over a whopping 100 followers on my Instagram. I loved my IG handle up until I started receiving hate messages and needed to change it. SAD! 

My private message to Kaitlyn was never intended to hurt her feelings, and I made that clear to her after she expressed that I made her cry. From my standpoint, I was providing constructive criticism although some may believe my delivery to be a bit harsh. 

There‚Äôs always more to the story. We exchanged additional messages that really did not result into anything. She reiterated that I made her upset and what I said was hurtful. I extended multiple apologies and that my intentions were not to hurt her, and even offered my opinions to what I think would improve her podcast, however unsure how those were perceived. To each their own. 

I read every Reddit comment, and thank you to the people who supported where I was coming from.

I‚Äôve seen the posts that she has made. When she went live on IG, she acknowledged my apology. I have not received an apology from her and I do not expect I will. Will I lose sleep over it? No. My daily life will go on, with new podcasts to listen to, amazon scrunchies, and getting used to my new Instagram name. 

Take care."	1572032154.0
