Or were they on the Seagard side of it and crossing over? And if so, why? Was it cause of the Battle of Whispering Wood? If that were the case, why couldn't they just cross at Riverrun?

[Spoilers] What on earth is going on with Bran?!	0	dmnwkq	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dmnwkq/spoilers_what_on_earth_is_going_on_with_bran/	10	"I'm on season 6, episode 8 (haven't watched 8 yet). I simply cannot understand what the heck is going on with Bran's plotline. Please, when explaining, don't further spoil it beyond season 6. Thank you!

Okay, so this is what I understood by far:

1. Bran has weird dreams with a three-eyed raven. In earlier seasons he tells Osha of this and she ignored it. These dreams are sometimes prophetic as Bran has experienced the death of Ned through a dream while Ned was beheaded in King's Landing, unbeknownst to Bran. Rickon has these powers too as he had the same dream.

2. Bran decides somehow to go North with Osha, Rickon and Hodor to find Jon in Castle Black after family crisis. Along the way, if I remember correctly, he is approached by Jojen and his sister Mira. Jojen tells him to find the three eyed raven and this tree or whatever. So Jojen and Mira go on to travelveith Bran. Eventually they find Jon in Craster's Keep, battling other gone-rogue Night's Watch members. While Osha and Rickon encourage Bran to go up to Jon and save all of them, Bran is encouraged to continue beyond the wall and find the goddamn three eyed raven by Jojen. Jojen is killed protecting Mira by the rogue Night's Watch. Bran ends up fscing the guy who chopped Jamie's hand off (can't remember his name, sorry). Jon is sad about this later. Bran and the group, without Jojen as he's dead, continue North of the Wall.

3. Osha tells Bran she won't go North of the wall, as it is too dangerous, and won't go back there. The group splits, with Osha taking Rickon away back to Jon and Bran, Mira and Hodor continue to the wall. Osha and Rickon are later taken hostage by Ramsay Bolton who ends up killing Osha, and yes, I know episode 9 will bring the Battle of the Bastards along with it.

4.  I'm not sure if he actually crosses the wall or what, but Bran somehow just pops into this cave with this old weird dude, a tree, and these Forest Kids who have powers. This is where it starts to get messy. By this point, I am missing something- how did he find and get into that cave? I know this Forest Girl lead him, but how did he know where to go? How did he know what is the three eyed raven? WHAT IS THE THREE EYED RAVEN?

5. Now it's the tricky part. Bran connects to this tree with the old guy, and they can see the past together. Simple enough, they can see the past. Apparently the old guy is the three eyed raven, okay. But Bran takes too many risks and delves into the realm of the past on his own. There he meets the Night King who touches him. By this touch, the Night King can now enter the cave, that was previously protected by a spell of sorts. Now it is dangerous, the Night King is coming!

6. Bran watched the creation of the Night King- the Forest Kids were threatened in their natural habitat by the men who originally came from Essos. The Children took a man, and pushed a wooden dagger into his heart, thus making him the Night King. They made him to protect them and aid with fighting against the Andals, but it backfired and now he threatens everyone. I think that was a stupid idea to begin with, but I can see where it came from. Also, Bran's powers were shared by the smartest of the Forest Children.

7. Now the Night King arrives with his zombie and skeleton army. Bran is again connected to the tree, busy with the past. This time he is at Winterfell, watching his aunt Lysanna. He sees Hodor, before he was Hodor, his name was Wylis and he was a Winterfell stable boy. Then suddenly, Wylis falls to the ground and seems to be experiencing some kind of an Epilepsy episode. He shakes and trembles. He starts shouting ""Hold The Door, Hold The Door!"" Until the words become unclear and turn into ""Hodor"". Meanwhile, in the present, Mira and the Forest Children are under attack by the skeletons. Mira needs to escape and tries waking Bran up from his trance state. He hears her in the dream and eventually snaps out. The old guy tells Bran that this is the end and to continue his legacy or work or whatever, and the vanishes ,as he is killed by the incoming skeletons. Bran snaps out of the dream and is taken by Hodor outside. Mira puts Bran on a sled and starts dragging him away in the snow. While doing that, she commands Hodor to hold the door to the cave, trapping the skeletons inside as he cries ""Hodor"" while holding the door. Mira then drags Bran away as Hodor is killed.

A few questions:

1. Did Hodor see his future and decide to call himself Hodor? Why didn't he stay Wylis as he was supposed to be? Why didn't he become Jodor only at his moments of death? I didn't get the whole Hodor name thing and would like an explanation on that.

2. Why is Bran so important? People are dying here for a poor kid with no legs and a very active mind. Why is he SO important? Yes, he will be king, but other people can be kings. He is not the only option out there. So why is everyone sacrificing everything for him?

3. What the heck is the deal with the three eyed raven? Who is he? What did he want from Bran? Why Bran? What does it mean to ""be the next three eyed raven""? Did this man just send signals to Bran to find him with dreams? Why him?

4. What do Bran powers truly do? Change the past? View the past? I don't really understand, since in the scene with Ned Stark's fight in the padt, Ned does seem to hear him in the past. So does Bran change the pasg or just has a look at it? Can Bran see the past of anyone, anytime? I need a really deep explanation about his powers.

Sorry for bombarding you guys with questions, but I need to get these things before moving on with the show! Thanks!"	1571984541.0

**The Future in a Dream**

While Valyria was the greatest city ‚Äúthere is and ever will be‚Äù of the known world, many so called dragon riders protected the city. No famous people, just one of the many with no name or special heritage. Not one was remembered by the books of the citadel. They were soldiers. One could only imagine what kind of live they had. Living in the wealthiest city of the world, protecting it, being respected and in company of dragons. And after the doom of Valyria everyone, everything and every dragon was gone. The knowledge of how to build cities like that, lost. The only survivors the world knows of, are the Tagarions. They left the city after one of the daughters had a dragon dream, looking in the future and seeing what would happen. After a few generations of prosperous trading, this family, which wasn‚Äôt in any way or form powerful became the most powerful family of the Westeros.

But as the citadel tells this story and everybody knows this story is just that. A tale of doom. Something parents tell the children to scare them, just a story, we tell ourselves over and over until we forget that it‚Äôs a lie! Or is it?

The tale of the Doom 

The Valyrian were in the wrong and the world revolted. Some believe it was the spirit of the Roine, which revolted against the oppression of the native people in the proximity of the river, who took it as their god. When the Valyrian poisoned the river, killing the natives the spirit made sure this wouldn‚Äôt happen again. Others believe, that it was the biggest dragon who died in captivity and couldn‚Äôt become what he came from. Dragons are fire made flesh. When a dragon cannot become fire again, he will develop gasses and if they catch fire no dragon would survive the firestorm. That‚Äôs the way the citadel describes the doom. But what really happened only the ones responsible new.

Left to grow strong by itself it grew too strong to control. Like the undying were saying: magic is the strongest in proximity of dragons, and there were many dragons. Since magic was so prominent, in that time, not only respected but searched for, the sorcerers in the black tower used blood magic, to get more powers, the rest of the word wouldn‚Äôt even dream of. Using the blood of human children, dragons and animals, they created their own enclave in the city, where nobody was physically able to get in without having their seal of approval. At first, they were supposed to protect the city. They did, they had success doing it, and becoming more powerful, every time they did. Using the blood of the slain armies, they made themselves immortal. Even the most powerful families in the city wouldn‚Äôt dare to speak up to them, fearing the consequences, involving living sacrifices. Not of animals but of their suns and daughters. With nobody to keep them in check, they grew too strong. 

Since the mages kept everybody sort of save, there was not much to do for the new generation of dragon riders. Earlier while the city grew in size and not in height, others, jealous of the riches of the city, dared to attack the city and were fought back by the dragon riders. They were true heroes. Defending the city, living for the city and dying for it.

The simple one‚Äôs knowledge is that when a beast or animal bonds with a man, the man receives some of the properties of the beast. That way the bravest and strongest man will become a coward, when being inside a deer for too long. In reverse, the nicest and kindest man will become barbaric when staying inside a wolf for too long. Dragons on the other hand are kind of balances for the ones who connected to them. They do not have a personality at first. The first one to bond with them gives the personality to them. That way the dragon acts like you. But therefore, grounds the person who is connected to that personality. That way many Tagarions who lived with Aegon‚Äôs dragon, the black dread, were calm, collected and humble. When the dragons died out, these trades died out too. And in its place the insanity made room for itself. Now when a beast dies while connected to a human, a piece of the rider dies with it, but the beast will live in the rider‚Äôs head for some time, before the memories merge into one consciousness. Even the dead dragons beneath Dragonstone did its due. Every owner of the castle became much quieter and much more thoughtful, even though the dragons never had contact with the man living there ever after. But not only positive things came to the people living in Dragonstone. The smaller dragons always lived in fear, to be eaten by the bigger ones and therefore developed a suspicious nature. They were so small, that when they died, nobody noticed and their bones were still lying in the corners, on the support beams and everywhere, where nobody would clean for centuries. 

**Sherine** 

While flying, far over the highest towers of the city, something was of. The air was too flat, there were no birds and all the dragons were nervous. This nervous behavior normally came only up when a wild dragon gets near the baby dragons. And then only the baby dragons seem to feel that way. The dragons felt that a massive danger was making its way to Valyria. The most dragon rider went down to the ground to report the eminent danger to the mages, they should know what is going on. Every dragon except one was now down. Sirius, a rider who was trained with me, still many years older than me shouted at me:‚Äù Come down, you may at least make some good impressions for the noble boys down there. They probably don‚Äôt even know, that you exist, and that would be too sad. A rich family with slaves‚Ä¶‚Äù My squint made him stop. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I forgot, but I‚Äôd bet, you would be a better master than all of them bitching and whining girls of the noble families, and I‚Äôm betting with you, when they see you, you won‚Äôt have a single minute of time alone.‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúFirst of all, I don‚Äôt want anybody who just wants me because of my looks, I want to know him or her, I‚Äôm ok with both‚Ä¶‚Äù I winked at him ‚ÄúAnd if there is a serious danger coming, I want to be up here. I want to see what‚Äôs going on. And if not, well I had some alone time with Merisax. Something I value more than a big house with slaves!‚Äù Now he shook his head: ‚ÄúOk ok, I get it. Well then, we will see each other in the barracks. He was always that ignoring of danger. That‚Äôs what I liked about him. He was the only one who could get me of the wall, when I was upset, sad or angry. He would come to me, even when everybody was leaving me. He, his dragon, Serion and Merisax were the only ones I cared for in this godforsaken city. Even though this city had something worth living in. I shouted: ‚ÄúI bet on it!‚Äù and then quiet ‚ÄúAnd good luck for the wars to come.‚Äù  The explosion hit the city, when I was high in the air, but it reached us in mere seconds. We both fell, ripped out of the clouds, like ripe fruits. I closed my eyes. Trying to stay calm and let my dragon reclaim security. She felt my trust into her, but she wasn‚Äôt able to perform. I felt her pain, her sorrow, that she wouldn‚Äôt be able to protect me like the years past. The only thing she was able to do was to slow my fall. She protected me my fall was soft, but my head hit something hard and everything went black. What happened to her, I couldn‚Äôt tell.   

When I woke up, the only thing I could remember, was that the firestorm came from the highest city tower. The place, where the mages conducted their experiments. Blodmagic. Forbidden in any other city but thriving in Valyria. They had overdone it this time. After the explosion nothing was standing anymore, only ruins and the smell of burned flesh. Nothing, no dragons no human no beast no animal. Nothing had survived the doom except of me. Because my dragon saved me.

**Chapter One:**

I had to do. No people to report to, no one to talk to, I panicked. I screamed for help, but the only thing that screamed back was the deafening silence. I wondered aimless through the city, hoping to find someone or at least something that could remind me of what I and everybody lost in this city, being it the humanity, the people of Valyrira lost a long time ago or in my case, my dragon, my friends my home. 

While searching the blasted ruins of my home for something useful, I came across the places. Before, I was only able to dream, of entering it.  One of the great city-halls. The place where only the high lords made their business, where nobody but the finest people would be. Something told me not to go there. If it was fear or something else, I couldn‚Äôt tell. Not minding these bad feelings, I made my way up the 500 stairs of now blacked marble. It was a stunning sight, just minutes before, now the towers are gone, blasted away, the white, almost blinding sight was gone. Everything was just dark, blackened by the fire. The ornaments watched me with a strange look in their eyes. The bodies had been melted down by the fire. The cracking heat, formed the stone figures, bowed their neck, in an unnatural and unconvertable way. I entered through the main forte. The big doors were blasted open. But I realized, that the grate hall was in quite decent condition. No cracking stone inside, no burned pillows only a few dark spots on the floor. I stepped close to one of these stains, so I could see what these were. They were burned man and women, who tried to run inside. I could see the gems of their clothes sparkle through the ashes and crumbling bones. A Breeze swirled the ashes up and let the bones fall to dust. The air in the room had a burned flavor. It was bitter, and even though I‚Äôve seen and smelled much worse, I vomited. I didn‚Äôt realize what fire could do to a body. Ironic coming from a dragonrider, but I was never in a battle before, nor had my dragon ever killed someone with fire. I ran through the main hall, trying to evade the still smoking piles of body dust of the recently deceased. A small room was my save haven. It was the place where all the guardians of the city were lying, who died defending exactly that. ‚ÄúNow for noting, I guess‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought. Still the graves draw me to them. I wandered past the newest graves. Gerriues was the last one. He fell from a horse and broke his neck, after riding a dragon for 50 years. It must have been a bad joke for his family, that he was buried here. Visible for everybody. The next one was Cassius the fierce, Tassius, Cassandra the just, the graves reach back to Drius the defender, the first, who climbed a dragon, the first dragon rider and first hero of the city. Probably not the first one who died for the city, but the first hero. At least in the stories the trainers told. He wielded a Valyrian steel sword. This sword does not corrode, doesn‚Äôt get blunt or damaged. The perfect weapon. I looked at it. The past years I always dreamed of having one of these grate weapons. It‚Äôs not only an honor to have one, but it‚Äôs the finest blade one could imagine owning. I took it. Took it out of the scabbard and with the thought, that I would bring it to better use than leaving it with the dead, I named it ‚ÄúKeeper‚Äù. As a memory of my dragon, my city and myself and my friend Sirius. So that I would my keep them in good memories.  

I would need to leave the city at one point or the other. I had no supplies and the surrounding was still smoking and burning. The smoke was as dense as a curtain and only let a bit of sun in. 

Since I had too much time doing nothing, I wanted to start doing something. So, I wandered though the city, finding other places which weren‚Äôt that bad damaged. 

The great library was close to be unharmed and the bocks only in a very dry condition. In theory the people should have survived in here but seemingly nobody was here in a while... But since there were places that weren‚Äôt damaged that badly I still had hope to find someone living. Be it a dog, cat or preferable a human. Strangely the silence that fell over Valyria was sort of nice, living in a city where dragons flew over it, roaring, the mines, the forges and all the humans were quiet now. It was like humans never were here in the first place.

I began to read some books but there were some, that caught my attention. Those were about the mages. They were bound in heavy leather, were thick and heavy. They already had me in their ban when I first glanced over them. They had something special about them. Something I couldn‚Äôt explain but I was drawn to them. They had the power to take lives without any warning. And of cause destroy on a scale no dragon could. Not only was I drawn to the books but also the place they originated. It was the place where the explosion came from. I remembered who was responsible for this genocide of a city of close two million. A city even bigger than Kingslanding while the rain of the mad king. But when I explored the library, read a few books, and put them back, I lost the track of time. When I came out of the massive building, it was already late in the day. The sun hid behind the massive fog and the only thing reminding of its existence was a light glare between the clouds. It was getting darker by every minute.  

Most of the ground was white like snow. Except, it wasn‚Äôt frozen water, it was the burned remains of the people of the city. It reminded me that I had to get out of the city, as fast as possible. People had to know what the mages had done. They all would have to suffer, what these monsters had done. But first I had to gain vision. And the only place, where I would be able to do so was the tower of the mages. If only one of them would have survived I would behead him right where he stands. 

Before I would have never imagined to be up there. It was the last place a dragon rider would be. As one could represent one¬¥s case before the ‚Äúwise rulers‚Äù, can be named hero of the city and marry a girl or boy of a great family. But to get up the tower, one would have to be chosen by the mages or born as a mage. 

On my way to the tower, I realized, how beautiful the city was. Massive arches, many statures of former important people and beautiful facades. Everything was designed to be as impressive as possible. But I never saw it the way, it is now, before. Either, I was high up, where the smog of the city covered the architecture. Or on the floor, the markets, the people and animals in the city always blocked the view. They covered the beauty by there presence. Now the city was ‚Ä¶  
 clean,    empty,   dead. 

**Chapter two:**

I realized, that I would have to hurry, to get to the top of the tower, when I wanted to see further then the light of the moon would provide me. I started to jog, passing the house of the masters, I saw chains, chains which were used to hold slaves, now they were holding nothing, not even bones. No‚Ä¶, I remembered what I wanted to remind myself, by naming my sword. ‚ÄúKeeper‚Äù I gasped. Remembering the people, I was once part of. Those chains still held something for me! 

The memories of me, the slave of the city, the people, who build, served and died for the city. Turning left, I stated to run. I felt something pushing me, a feeling that someone or something was stalking me, with hungry eyes, it followed me through the ruins of the street. I turned into the street of the builders, ‚Äúan arrogant name‚Äù, I almost cried out. ‚ÄúThey only had the best housings, because THEY had them build by the slaves.‚Äù I waited for a response, but nobody wanted to stop me, so I continued. ‚ÄúNo wonder the slave masters moved their business right next to them!‚Äù Earlier I was always stopped by Serion‚Ä¶ I screamed at the ruins of a mansion. The first time I **really** was frustrated.  

The silence was killing me!

I had a headache from screaming and no water.  

And my sides stung, since I hadn‚Äôt eaten since morning.

Out of breath I reached one house. But it stood still tall. Not a single window was broken. I stopped. I screamed for someone to come out or I would come in. Nothing, not a single sound was there to hear. 

The silence was annoying me. 

I tried to run the door in. Nothing, the door didn‚Äôt move a single inch. Another time, nothing, only a dark ‚Äúumpf‚Äù.  The former owner must have had a mage to protect his home, unfortunately for him, not the owner himself. Ironic, valuing the ownings higher than his own live. I couldn‚Äôt do anything else but smile‚Ä¶ Impressing what those mages could do, but it gave me confidence, that I had to hunt every single and last one of them. This fight they may have won, but not the war‚Ä¶

Leaving the house behind, passing the street, now sneaking further, I reached the inner tower group. Normally there were guards, not letting anybody through, ‚Äúkeep the peasants out‚Äù, like my sword master would have said. Now I could just go straight past it. The strange feeling overcame me coming again, coming closer to the biggest tower. My breathing normalized, wehn I reached the massive complex. I had shivers running down my spine. I realized, it wasn‚Äôt only the tower, the highest building in the city, towering over everything, but it was the mages. They didn‚Äôt want me in their living quarters, fear me away from their experiments. Keep me out of the place, in which I hoped every single and last one of them died. If not, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to do exactly that, what the doom wasn‚Äôt able to do! 

I stood in front of the main gate. A massive, with steel reinforced wooden double door, made to keep out what wasn‚Äôt allowed to be inside.  I stared at it for a few seconds. A really heavy door, nonetheless I tried to open it. I imagined myself using every single mussel in my body, but with a single small push. The doors swung wide open and crashed into the wall behind it. A loud ‚ÄúBANG‚Äù echoed inside the building, loosing itself in the ashes around me.

Passing through the gate I entered the first floor. I had to search for the staircase. At first I didn‚Äôt want to investigate every room to find it but since only the first floor was as big as the whole library, I had to open every single door. In the every single room I found nothing except coles and ashes of the burned, their pets and interieur. After a long search for this dang staircase, I finally found it, but had to rest for a few seconds. This building was huge, the staircase on the other hand was as small as it could be. Small and high stairs, but extremely narrow. Maybe two little children were able to go upstairs next to each other, holding hands. At first, I wanted to investigate into every room in this tower, maybe I‚Äôd find somebody, I would be able to turn my anger, frustration, sorrow and grief against. Many told me, that these motives were the best motives. ‚ÄúThese motives will give you strength. They will give you stamina!‚Äù 

But I just felt miserable. 

I really never cared much for this city. I was born a slave and was supposed to die a slave. If it wasn‚Äôt for Merisax, saving me from that fate, I would have died in the mines or as a prostitute in one of the many brothels. She saved me by choosing me. She hedged out of the egg, escaped the underground breeding areas and ran straight to me. From that day I was a dragonrider and she never left my side.  If I was inside, she had to be there to, when she grew too big, she just watched me from outside, from a window or somewhere else. She trained with me, hunted with me and fought with me, even if our enemies only were bandits or thieves. 

I missed her‚Ä¶ 

My thoughts became foggy climbing the stairs. The air wasn‚Äôt as dense as downstairs. Additionally, the fog, I now realized wasn‚Äôt fog, it was smoke, forming a dome above the city, and I was slowly climbing into it. The walls became pitch black. Everything was black. The stairs and the stones. I felt wired. Somehow there was a light red glowing. But I didn‚Äôt know what it was. Suddenly I heard crunching under my feet. Bones. Falling apart like leaves in fall. Not one thought of trying to secure these bones for a burial came to my mind. These People were responsible for the death of millions‚Ä¶ and my dragon, my friends. Stumbling over bones that weren‚Äôt that brittle, then over still fleshy body parts. There were more people up here than I thought. Weather these people tried to run away from the impending doom or running into it, to shut it down, I could not say. Every step felt wrong. A dark rumbling became every more present, soft vibration in the air were getting hard and forcing my breath to run away from me. This place was empty. No animal was up here, not even a single fly feasting on the corpses. Everything was screaming GET AWAY! But resisting the urge to get as far away as possible I climbed even higher. While the air got thinner, the feeling of danger came closer and closer, I drew my sword, Keeper. Hoping it would protect me, same as my dragon did. The steel was the source of the red glow. It helped. It was not a glow of red hotness. More like blood, that was draining the swords magic and overloaded its capabilities to stay in its form. I never thought blood magic could forge a sword but seemingly that‚Äôs how valerian steel was made. And how it kept its form for all eternity. 

The floor became sticky, but the grip got worse, a little slippery. There was a smell of metal in the air and the glow of the sword revealed that my surrounding, slowly but steady, changed. From Chole black, to dark red. What ever happened here, it seemed that the people exploded. Their blood, the last thing to be seen from them. There was so much blood, that the stones were drained in it, every gap was filled by it. Even the sealing was colored by it. I just wanted to get down. But close before my survival instincts kicked in, close before I was about to turn around, not wanting to get lost in an invite loop, I reached the top. A heavy metal door stood in my way. It freaked me out. You could see how the men and woman tried to get inside. The Shadows of their bodies were still there. The last thing what existed of these people were their shadow. The protection of their bodies was visible on the metal. It got weakened at the points where the heat hit it without flesh, ribs and bones in the way and it started to peel off the door. Still a heavy door, I thought, I would never be able to get inside. I thought that there had to be multiple man necessary, to open it. I tried to open it anyway. 

**Third Chapter**

The door made some strange noises. Metal with wasn‚Äôt moved for some time had to leave its resting position and brake its bonds which connected over the time. Then I heard a crack and with a scream. The door exploded open. Surprised how easily this door opened I fell after it. The sun was so bright in this moment that I had to duck away, realizing, that I haven‚Äôt seen the sun for an eternity. The fresh air was rushing through my body and brain, making my mind as sharp as ever. The explosion must have ripped a part of the top of the tower away, revealing the sky, the real clouds, I was able to touch riding Merisax. A sharp but young voice cut me out of my thoughts. ‚Äú*who are you*?‚Äù asked a small voice. I jumped back, raising my sword. A small figure, with the body of a girl, stepped out of the dark shadows into the room. Shocked that someone had survived and that someone was a little girl. ‚ÄúI¬¥m Sherine, a dragon rider‚Äù I heard myself saying, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù The girl had now a piercing lock on her face. Locking at my sword, which was still glowing red. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù The girl asked without answering my question in the slightest. So, I ignored her question too and went for a counter attack. ‚ÄúHow did you survive?‚Äù I asked with a strong and daring voice. Remembering back, it must have sounded like she did something wrong by surviving. Because this time she answered a bit on the backfoot, her eyes still fixated on my sword: ‚ÄúI believe, I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù My jaw dropped. Hearing my voice still in a demanding Thone: ‚ÄúAnd why would you think that?‚Äù Holding back my protective instinct and getting her out of here, with all the bodies of the sorcerers. She stepped back into the shadows ‚ÄúLock around, everybody is dead!‚Äù she cried out. I heard her crying, thinking back, I never cried, not even when my dragon died. I just had no one who would ever listen to me when I was little, my knowledge was, that if I want something, I either had to fight for it, or pay for it. Emotion was a weakness, that nobody should see. The only thing I was emotionally connected with, was my dragon. The way I loved her‚Ä¶ Tears ran down my cheeks thinking back. The afternoon light colored the room into a bright orange. The sun covered my face, the warm light was refreshing. The first time I stopped to appreciate the beauty of light. I lowered my sword from my defensive guard and let the sun shine in. Taking in as much as I could. Then I felt a warm body pressing against mine. I did not resist. I closed my eyes.

**Forth Chapter**

But her thoughts were not letting me go. Am I alive? Better are we alive? My pulse was present, I can bleed. I had hunger and thirst, but how did we survive. I survived a fall of hundreds of feet and she survived in a room full of dead. I heard tales from the north. People were getting resurrected. There is the house of the undying. The red Priestess from Pentos, the legend says that she can¬¥t get older nor die. But these are only tales, legends. But there is always some truth in a sailor‚Äôs story. 

‚ÄúWhat¬¥s your name by the way?‚Äù I asked. Still soaking in the warmth and the energy of the sun. ‚ÄúI never was supposed to have a name.‚Äù she replied cold as ice, ‚ÄúI was raised up here, I was supposed to die up here. **I** was supposed to die, **not** the city!‚Äù. I kept quiet. I didn‚Äôt know what to answer to that. I tried to cheer her up by asking her that but‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou said you were a dragon rider.‚Äù I still gazed into the evening sun. ""Where is you dragon?""

But D&D were very well capable of transforming the written books by G.R.R. Martin into a TV show format, I think despite all the shitting on them, people seem to easily forget that they were skilled in transforming a given script in a very well produced TV show and that authors sometimes want to move forward to other projects. An opportunity to write for something like Star Wars is rare and the question is what other people would do in their position.

I want to be clear: How they handled this was completely wrong and showed disrespect to the fans, it was completely rushed and some events in the way how they happened made no sense, I could see how an apology to the fans or admitting that there are things went wrong would be a first step on the side of D&D, but many people seem to either only see the negative or only the positive. Without D&D who had the idea to produce this show, it wouldn't exist."	1571946880.0

I know most of them didn't, but for the life of me I can't figure out why any of them remained.

Following Dany goes against their entire culture and she hadn't even done anything to earn enough respect for them to defy their own nature. At that point, all she had done was stop them from raping and pillaging - something that obviously wouldn't earn their friendship.

I can understand why the women might have wanted to follow her, but certainly not the men. And I don't even understand why the women were allowed to follow her - as slaves they should have been forced to follow one of the two new Khals.

Can anyone think of a reason as to how Dany managed to have an entourage with her at all when she wandered in to Qarth?"	1571918611.0

[SPOILERS] Who does everyone think the Lord of Highgarden will marry?	4	dlsn5l	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dlsn5l/spoilers_who_does_everyone_think_the_lord_of/	4	"He was promised a highborn wife and he needs one to create a noble house. I think Sam's younger sister makes the most sense. The Tarly's are one of the most powerful houses in the Reach so marrying into Houss Tarly would really help him consolidate his rule. She was engaged to a Fossoway in season 6 I think but there's no reason why that coudlnt have happened.

Another question, whos is the current Lord of Horn Hill? Unless King Bran changed thr rules of Maesters not being able to marry or rule then Gillys inbred son Baby Sam would be the rightful heir (if legitimized) since everyone thins he's Sam's son. A son comes before a sister. 

I think Sam is the lord though otherwise why would he be at the Great Council that elected Bran as King? Then again why is Bran, Arya, Brienne (is she Lady of Tarth or did her father Selwyn survive the series?) Davos (he has a castle in Stormlands but he's only a ser, not a lord) and so on there if they aren't a lord or lady?

Other possible wives from show only:
Lady Meera
Lady Yara
Queen Sansa
Gilly (fuck it why not?)
Sam's mum Melassa (milf anyone?)
Lollys Stokeworth (that would be hilarious if he ended up back with her?)

She considers killing him there but then she doesn‚Äôt.  This frustrates many fans that Cersei the cruel unpredictable bitch didn‚Äôt kill Tyrion who she has always hated and wanted to kill. But people also thought this was a betrayal to her character not to have some master plan when her enemies are right in front of her. But I say something different. I saw the same evil women that‚Äôs been on this show for years. Because even if she killed them then and there she would never last long. She would still have most of Westeros against her. But she decided she was not gonna go down without a fight. Tyrion is pleading to Cersei saying her reign is over, but that doesn‚Äôt mean your life has to end, your baby doesn‚Äôt have to die. A lot of people are saying Tyrion is somehow being stupid with thinking Cersei would ever surrender. And I don‚Äôt think he totally believes she would have surrendered. But it‚Äôs like he says to Qyburn he doesn‚Äôt want to hear children burn. He is trying to avoid violence. This is the Tyrion Lannister I know. And I believe Cersei‚Äôs big plan was to take Kings landing down with her. She knew killing Missandei would trigger Dany. Also the acting in this scene is brilliant. You can tell Emilia Clarke did not agree with the ending they gave her character, and she was great nonetheless. That‚Äôs a true professional. But let‚Äôs not forget Lena only saying one line in the whole scene and yet showing show much emotion. When Tyrion mentions her baby she cries. Just such a thematic scene. Let me know what you thought.	1571551591.0

At the earliest he was born in 264, three years after the Red Lion's Rebellion. At best, he's the son of an ten year old. Ser Bronn was born between 264 and 268. The last book was in 300 and the last season was 306, making him 36 in the books and 42 in the show, too young to be the last Tarbeck/Reyne. It is possible a Reyne/Tarbeck lives on, though more probable that they are extinct. However, it is semi-likely that he could be Brandon Stark, though that is a hole-filled theory as well. It is most likely he was some bastard, watch-deserter sellsword.	1571545465.0

[SPOILERS] This is what I believe really happened...	4	dk2kml	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dk2kml/spoilers_this_is_what_i_believe_really_happened/	4	"&#x200B;

1. Tree-Eyed Raven is the arch enemy for the years to come. In Winterfell, Bran is extremely cruel/cold towards Meera Reed who supposedly saved his life. He says to her he is Tree-Eyed Raven now, letting her go away in tears. He says the same thing to some other people too. It is so because that‚Äôs the truth - Tree-Eyed Raven skinchanged into Bran and merged with him. He is the most powerful skinchanger that ever was and ever will be. We don‚Äôt even know what he was in the beginning ‚Äì definitely not a human being. He is the ‚ÄúSauron‚Äù of A Song of Ice and Fire. Back in the cave, Tree-Eyed Raven says he‚Äôs waited a thousand years for Bran to come into his cave - he waited for someone with Brans' abilities to be able to finally exit that cave. In the book he also says that he has many names, and it is because over the centuries he had lured many skinchangers into his cave and merged with them to stay alive. Those skinchangers were very weak greenseers so he had to be in constant contact with the tree to be able to manipulate the world events. Previous Tree-Eyed Ravens‚Äô/Crows‚Äô dying body was Brynden Rivers/Lord Bloodraven, the Lord Commander of Night‚Äôs Watch, around 100 years old. In reality Tree-Eyed Raven is thousands of years old. He is the evil force behind many bad things that happened in Westeros, including the magical creation of White Walkers/Night King. In the previous war against the Others, Children of the Forest had played a double game, in reality protecting Tree-Eyed Raven who has been controlling White Walkers from the day one. Children believe he is their ally, but he is not. He manipulates Bran to get touched by the Night King so that White Walkers could later easily find him and protect him, but also to come to the cave to destroy his old body and kill the last Children of the Forest he doesn‚Äôt need anymore. During the Second Battle of Winterfell Tree-Eyed Raven works against men, probably communicating with the Night King and commanding him. Arya messed up his plans at the last moment. But he knows how to create White Walkers, and he is in the position of ultimate power now from where he can more efficiently work on destroying humanity. White Walkers will not be needed anymore, I suppose, one big dragon to merge with/skinchanged into would be more than sufficient.
2. Fire demon R‚Äôhllor needs humans to live and he knows if he doesn‚Äôt intervene in the battle against Tree-Eyed Raven, he is going to perish together with his worshipers. That is the reason why he resurrects Jon and Beric, why he sends Melisandre to unite Dany with Jon, why Melisandre cames back to Winterfell, etc. He probably projected many instructions that day in Winterfell that men subliminally absorbed from fires. R‚Äôhllor is the force behind the victory. But he never helps free of charge, probably because he loses energy in the process. He feeds on human sacrifices and he wants many people burned to repay for the help he provided. Dany has always been cruel, but she is Defender of weak and powerless. Dany never went crazy. Lord of Light manipulated her with the visions in Drogons‚Äô fires and made her harm those she‚Äôs sought to protect (just like he did to Stanis). She was the only one who could do what was needed to be done. That day in King's Landing Dany saved humanity because she empowered R‚Äôhllor so that now he will be able to destroy Tree-Eyed Raven once and for all. Drogon knows what has to be done. He has to take Dany to Daario Naharis, the only man left Drogon sees as a friend and knows to love Dany, and who rules over Meereen full of red priestesses. Daenerys is the only one who can prevent Tree-Eyed Raven from merging with Drogon, and R‚Äôhllor has to resurrect her. Tree-Eyed Raven in the body of Drogon would practically be unstoppable.
3. After resurrection, Dany should be much better person. Jon killed her even though he loved her, and that fact should reveal to her that she was wrong. She knows Jon is extremely just and good person, and she deserved to die - not for what she did in King‚Äôs Landing, but for what she said to him before he killed her. When she finds out he went to the North, she will know beyond any doubt what kind of person he is. It would be nice if they would reunite in the final battle once again.

I hope G.R.R.M. will continue the story and somehow find the way to free Bran from Tree-Eyed Raven and give us better ending than one we saw on TV show.

[Spoilers] How would you fix Cersei as a villain?	3	djy07l	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/djy07l/spoilers_how_would_you_fix_cersei_as_a_villain/	6	"It's quite clear to all that Cersei, like it or not, doesn't really have the makings of a ''final villain'' and never did at least on the show proper. While Cersei was seemingly set to be Mad Queen 2.0 with her destruction of the Sept of Baelor and part of King's Landing, the very next season forgot about this and made her pretty much useless as a foe for the Stark and Targaryen factions. Jaime made a masterful plan to abandon Casterly Rock and Euron took out Yara's fleet as well as the Sand Snakes, but Cersei herself did fuck all apart from be sadistic to the people who killed her daughter, break a promise to the Jon-Daenerys alliance about helping against the night King, and make an empty threat to Jaime.

In Season 8, it gets...even worse. Cersei is just moping around and crying, whining about elephants, having sex with Euron Greyjoy (another total joke of a character, although at least Cersei had potential to be a good villain if not a final one) without using it to manipulate him (something she was fond of doing in the books, and even in the early seasons), sends Tyrion and Jaime's friendly neighborhood sellsword to kill them, doesn't have the common sense to run away from or surrender to Daenerys's invasion until it's WAY too late, and ultimately dies not as a lioness with claws bared but as a weeping coward. Even S2 Cersei showed a thousand times more resolve in at least accepting her fate.

My question is, how would you guys fix her? One idea would be to make her the mad queen, not Daenerys, and have her be the one to blow up the entirety of King's Landing out of spite along with herself as a final act of defiance against the younger and more beautiful queen, possibly intending to take Daenerys out as well (this might or might not fail). Another idea would be for her to somehow collaborate with Euron and frame Dany for destroying KL or trick her into doing it whle the two escape, possibly involving stealing one of her dragons through Euron's dragonbinder horn (which too should've appeared on the show). Jaime finds out the truth, eventually tracks a now hidden Cersei down, and kills her."	1571482212.0

[Spoilers] Is Game of Thrones really that different from the traditional story?	8	djcvrj	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/djcvrj/spoilers_is_game_of_thrones_really_that_different/	23	"A lot of people cited Game of Thrones as their favorite show, myself included, because of the moral complexity present in the show. At first, it seemed that GoT, unlike many stories (Harry Potter and LoTR chief among them), takes a realistic look at people and their morality and has characters who are more morally grey (and therefore realistic) as opposed to be straightforward heroes or villains. Never mind the fact that even Harry Potter had its share of grey characters like Snape, Dumbledore and perhaps Draco (and his parents to a very very limited degree), and LoTR definitely made Boromir, Denethor, and Gollum pretty complex too, so one could argue whether this was ever a truly accurate belief. 

However, in light of how S8 ended, it's kind of hard to see that as still being true. From S1 to S8, there in fact are some clear ''good guys'' and some clear ''bad guys'', and yes, a few characters who start on one side and do end up on the other or nowhere at all. The Starks are very much the heroes of the story, and they remain heroic from beginning to end. Even the questionable or bad things they do are brushed under the carpet - Arya is never taken to task for the brutality of her killings when it comes to the Freys. Neither Sansa when it came to Ramsay. Jon goes beyond the Wall to be with friends and can come back any time considering Grey Worm just left. On the other hand, the Targaryens and Lannisters end up and are punished as villains. Jaime is unable to complete his redemption, Cersei dies a coward, and Tyrion is blamed for Daenerys's invasion (rightly or wrongly) as well as exempt from the history books for some reason. 

Even Dany's attack on KL is not exempt from this, and neither is the Night King's attack on Winterfell. Dany just becomes another evil villain instead of destroying KL by accident, say, through fighting Euron and the dragon he stole from her using a dragonbinder horn. That would even be realistic and fit in with GRRM's anti-war stance as a lot of war's horror in fact is relatively accidental and yet hurts innocents all the same. She could've ignited wildfire, possibly even be tricked into doing it by Cersei, destroying an entire city and going down in history as a butcher when her intentions weren't to go down as one. There is *no* element of gray to her corruption. Heck she is directly made out to be a Hitler type figure which is as evil as you can get. Never mind the fact that Dany has been compassionate AND ruthless - to just make her one and not the other not only is against her character, it also is against GRRM's own preference for gray and human characters."	1571375767.0

[Spoilers] War, Hypocrisy, and Game of Thrones	3	dj2f6m	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dj2f6m/spoilers_war_hypocrisy_and_game_of_thrones/	20	"Seeing as a lot of people cannot read or have their pitchforks at the ready for a fictional character, I'm going to point this out: this is NOT meant to be an article justifying or making excuses for Daenerys's sack of innocent civilians in King's Landing. This is, however, absolutely meant to be an article **pointing out the hypocrisy of how Daenerys is pushed to unreasonable standards in her invasion of KL so as to avoid casualties, when characters like Stannis and Robb Stark were not expected to hold to similar standards.** 

From S6 onward, Daenerys is advised by Tyrion ‚Äì and at first, herself agrees ‚Äì to not take King‚Äôs Landing with her forces immediately. In fact, Tyrion ‚Äì according to certain notes ‚Äì is said to want a ‚Äò‚Äôbloodless revolution‚Äô‚Äô ([https://twitter.com/burns\_alana/status/1156370338344787968](https://twitter.com/burns_alana/status/1156370338344787968)) in King‚Äôs Landing. Never mind how implausible the idea of such a revolution would be, as Cersei would never back down peacefully (this was clear from S6 alone, to say nothing of S7 or S8) and would unquestionably choose ‚Äò‚Äôviolence‚Äô‚Äô in one form or another. However, the weird part is that Daenerys ‚Äì and only Daenerys ‚Äì is held to this standard.

No one blamed or attacked Stannis for trying to storm and retake King‚Äôs Landing from the Lannisters. People in fact called him the ‚Äò‚ÄôMannis‚Äô‚Äô, and GRRM himself dubbed him a ‚Äò‚Äôrighteous man‚Äô‚Äô (he does this in both the books and the show, so even if Show!Stannis is much more evil than his book counterpart, it‚Äôs not because of his decision to storm KL which is common to both versions). Likewise, Robb was planning to storm KL himself in S1 in order to save Ned from the Lannisters, even calling all his banners:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR8nlgMKW7Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR8nlgMKW7Q)

Never mind the fact that even in real life, going to the enemy base or nation is kind of important at times to fully defeat the enemy. The Allies didn't just attack Nazi Germany from outside, they went inside at one point and even battled the Nazis there: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western\_Allied\_invasion\_of\_Germany#Montgomery\_launches\_Operation\_Plunder\_(23\_March)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Allied_invasion_of_Germany#Montgomery_launches_Operation_Plunder_(23_March))

The reality is, sometimes in war, you have to go in and fight the enemy in their home area. This is often a place where civilians also live. While that does not justify killing civilians willy nilly, it does kind of weaken the excuse Tyrion and many far-left liberal types today have towards war and conflict. Sometimes the only way vicious tyrants can be removed (and innocent people on both sides be protected) is through direct war and movement to defeat the enemy leadership. Ensuring that there are zero civilian casualties may be difficult or even impossible. Ultimately, it‚Äôs impossible to fully, truly prevent this but this shouldn‚Äôt get in the way of an overthrow.

I've also seen people saying Dany trying to take King's Landing from Cersei is a bad thing, because that might end up killing people. Never mind the fact that the Iron Throne is hers by right since Jon ceded it to her. On the other hand, literally no one had a problem with Jon and Sansa wanting to retake Winterfell from the Boltons, even though a lot of the Northern houses actually swore fealty to the Boltons anyway and didn‚Äôt want to help the Starks. Never mind the fact that the war to retake Winterfell could also potentially kill innocents there.

Even in Dany‚Äôs case, the soldiers she goes up against are humanized and presented to Arya as normal peasants with their own lives and families. However, the Bolton and Frey soldiers we saw on the show do not get this treatment, and any ‚Äò‚Äôgood‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äôinnocent‚Äô‚Äô Boltons or Freys are pretty much absent. Why do Lannister troops get humanized but not those on the Starks' opposite side?"	1571322766.0

Game of thrones was my favorite show of all time and I deeply loved EVERYTHING about it. A medieval fantasy a genre that I absolutley love , and with a bit of gritty realism to boot which I also enjoy as I started studying history... All with some decent at leaat 7 seasons, some of them which were truly great (1,2,3,4 and 6), it was a real joy to watch it all happen. I started watching Game of thrones since season 1 , long before it was any popular (I actually watched Rome first than heard about GoT because of HBO) and put all my hopes in HBO that they will do a medieval fantasy series justice (didn't knew about the books).

 Man I was surprised. Lived everything about. Than things started going downhill along the years especially in Season 7 , but I still had a bit of hope.

[SPOILERS] Sam's voting idea was terrible	0	ding4d	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ding4d/spoilers_sams_voting_idea_was_terrible/	12	" season 8 had alot of issues, one of the problems was most smart characters in the show where being dumb as fuck, one of them is sam. In the last episode of the show, when a bunch of lords where sitting and trying to decide who will rule the throne, Sam gave a suggestion that everyone should vote on who's gonna rule. the other lords laughed him off because they thought its a silly idea, and they where absolutely right.

In got's universe, some factions had a vote system to decide their rulers (i.e nights watch) and it would prove to be a good method for the most part, but putting a voting system like this on the scale of 7 kingdoms will make you run into severe problems.

a voting system is most effective if the people who vote are knowledgeable of the candidates and can have a reliable opinion on choosing the best leader. but in the medieval world you're going to have to deal with small folk. people with simple lives who are mostly illiterate, uneducated and are oblivious to anything outside their nearby vicinity. their best form of news about the outside world are tales and gossip, and it's very easy to bend the truth a little bit from mouth to mouth and change the story. so even if they actually had a good sense of mind on politics which they most likely aren't, voting for a faraway lord would be very rare simply because they don't know him and would rather vote on the lord that's ruling them or someone who is rules nearby.

Even if you would bring the small folk out of the picture and just include highborn, there will still be bias for any relatives that will be candidates or rivals that they might hold a grudge due to many wars and battles that had happened through the show.

This is just my thoughts on the things that would go wrong if large scale voting would be set in medieval times"	1571251073.0

I know this sounds ridiculous but if it had been well thought out early on and well written could it have been well received by the audience?

Ive noticed that all the main criticisms of the plot in the last series seem to hinge on things being either rushed or coming out of nowhere. Jon is built up as having this connection with Night King. It seems to single Jon out as its primary foe but then many fans feel that D and D tried to subvert expectations by having Arya kill him when there was no build up.

Dany to have a cruel and ruthless streak but again many feel there is a massive jump between killing off her enemies and slaughtering thousands of women and children with no remorse

So if say you decided Ramsay Bolton would be mellisandres saviour and built it up throughout the series with a clear line of reasoning pointing to him‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..would people accept if hes not the traditional hero?

So I suppose what im asking is can a very controversial idea work given enough build up and good writing?"	1571169189.0

[Spoilers] About Daenerys and Drogon	5	di0vcg	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/di0vcg/spoilers_about_daenerys_and_drogon/	25	"In hindsight, it seems pretty...weird to think that just killing Daenerys would end the potential threat that Drogon still poses. Drogon can burn cities to ash, with or without Dany's help - there's no reason to think otherwise. There was literally nothing and no one stopping Drogon from torching every other city in Westeros or outside - the scorpions were all gone, and there's no reason to assume other cities can just make their own in time before they get wrecked. 

Secondly, I still find it weird that Drogon just let Jon go instead of incinerating him on the spot. We know from the Dance of Dragons and other historical events that dragons are perfectly capable of killing Targaryens. Even if Drogon intended to screw off back to Essos instead of just burning random cities down in purposeless rage, there was no reason for him to not kill Jon when he had no problem killing complete innocents who at least didn't harm Daenerys at all.

Finally, it's worth pointing out that according to D&D, Drogon did not destroy the Iron Throne because he believed it was the true source of evil (which is technically stupid, not philosophical) but because it was just a random object he could take his rage out on and happened to be in his way."	1571133347.0
[Spoilers] How do you think that major events of S7-8 will happen in the books?	0	di4n8g	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/di4n8g/spoilers_how_do_you_think_that_major_events_of/	5	"I mean, I think that pretty much everything we saw in the show will happen in the books, but how will they happen? Here are my guesses:

\- Daenerys losts pretty much things when she first arrives to Westeros, as we saw in S7. But after the first attack in the Tyrell's lands (when she kills Tarlys) she attacks King's Landing with THREE dragons. I guess in the books they're not so big and one dragon can't destroy an entire city. Here she kinda destroys everything as we saw, but maybe not intentionally? I don't know, but I'm sure that this will happen BEFORE the Long Night.

\-I think we'll see the Lannisters death in half book 7. My guess is that Jaime kills Cersei as Jon did with Dany in S8, to ""protect"" her 'cause she's now a hopeless case. Maybe he figures this out after she makes the temple blow up, which might happen at the end of book 6.

\-About the dragons. I think they'll survive too. I believe that the Jon will end up on Rhaegal and someone else but NOT Tyrion on Viserion. Maybe a Greyjoy, has they have that horn? But I don't know what they could do after the Long Night.

\-Sansa will end up being Queen in the North. But just not by asking for it. 

\-Daenerys will die? Honestly I'm not sure. 

\-Jon instead WILL die. I mean, if he will be resurrected, once he does the job for R'hllor he should die. And of course his role will not be ""the one that gather all the forces for the Long Night"" as this doesn't have any sense, but to finally destroy the army fo the death. Once he does it, it can die.

\-Arya Stark... I don't know. For me, she seems kinda useless. We know D&D used her just to ""give us an unexpected scene"" and of course after it she doesn't do anything major to the plot. Also in s7 she doesn't do anything, apart from playing ""i trust you i don't trust you"" with Sansa. Her character is strange to me tbh. Also I think that the revenge against the Freys will be done by Cat.

\-Varys and Baelish won't die so stupidtly. I believe that Varys will be killed by Dany, but not in that way, not as a traitor. 

That's it. For some other characters, I don't know or I don't care: Brienne, Tyrion and Bran... we know their fate and that will be it. Not as we saw in the show, but it will be that."	1571155454.0

For someone like GRRM who literally critiqued, you know, an actually complete and successful series (LoTR) for this particular flaw (not mentioning Aragorn's tax policy or how he dealt with the orcs, et etc), it seems rather weird to leave out such a specific yet key detail (this is assuming D&D know literally anything about the actual ending, if at all, which admittedly is something I'd very much not like to believe).

The entire time I watch this show, be the first time or my hundredth rewatch, there‚Äôs things, facts I cannot forget:

Sansa was a bitch (and still is imnsho) who would go out of her way to make people feel bad.  
Lommy was a bully, thief, and had no arc to change any of that.  
Catlin went out of her way to make Jon feel as bad as he possibly could, and that was IN FRONT of Ned, seven knows what happened when he wasn‚Äôt there in the room.  

Yet, the love that Sansa gets on various forums, the ‚Äúno!‚Äù that reactors shout during the Lannister sack of the Night‚Äôs Watch recruiting convoy when Lommy is killed (with the same sword he tried to take/use against Arya... what I call ‚Äújustice‚Äù and ‚Äúirony‚Äù combined... an ironic justice üëå), or people just forget 1/6th of Catlin‚Äôs duties to her family was to try and mentally and emotionally destroy a child who had no where else to go to the point that he decided to make a pseudo ice prison his home (I hate blood, so I can‚Äôt enjoy the red wedding, but if it wasn‚Äôt for all that blood, I would‚Äôve enjoyed watching her get killed, even more so if someone jumped out on the screen and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you get for being an evil bitch to a helpless child‚Äù).  

I mean there‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù guy characters like Jaime and the Hound who people like and root for, but they‚Äôve accepted their roles as the bad guy and we often just hope they cross paths with a ‚Äúworse guy‚Äù, so I understand the people who are behind them.   

But the people who just go out of their way to hurt others for no reason like Sansa? Yeah, sorry bitch, I don‚Äôt feel bad for you. Based on her attitude and the way she treated her own servants, god knows what ever she did to Jon was way worse than that pathetic 10 second apology she gave. Someone who has the willingness to hurt a child when they have done nothing wrong, probably a lot less than their half siblings, because they exist? Yeah, I‚Äôd send her an invitation to the red wedding myself and wait on the rafters with a crossbow like that Coldplay guy did.   

TLDR: Sansa is a bitch, probably gets it from Cat, Neddy needed to get his house in line and give Cat a ‚Äúbadge of honor‚Äù every time she does something like that to Jon, and there‚Äôs a shit ton of other characters who‚Äôs actions get overlooked.   

On a side note: all those evil, horrible things Cersei did? At least she had a reason. I‚Äôd have blown up the Sept as well. The entire Tyrell army had a chance to end it and failed, therefor every life at that place is forfeit."	1570985065.0
[SPOILERS] West of Westeros, and seemingly a lack of curiosity	2	dh8bt9	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dh8bt9/spoilers_west_of_westeros_and_seemingly_a_lack_of/	10	"When Arya sets sail for her new adventure, she is, as her character should be, curious, and wants to explore. But everyone else, they seem relatively content with the answer that ""no one knows what lies west of Westeros"". In fact, no one even really seems to wonder about it, or even care, despite apparently being a huge mystery. This is, despite the fact that such information and exploration would seem highly relevant for many of the rulers, merchants and other similar groups in Westeros.

Could all this be some sort of reference to the Romans and medieval Europe, where no one really seemed to consider that there could be anything beyond the Atlantic ocean, or at least not make any serious efforts to explore it?"	1570987231.0

[SPOILERS] How different would the series be if the Targaryens (and Baratheon) dynasty followed the Ibn Saud method of maintaining Westeros?	2	dh5a76	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dh5a76/spoilers_how_different_would_the_series_be_if_the/	2	"So basically for those that don't know:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud

Ibn Saud won a civil war, kicked out an occupying force and unified Saudi Arabia (sound familiar?). However to cement and stabilize the country he married one person from every important tribe for said dynasty.

So I'm curious to know what would have happened if Aegon the Conqueror did this; basically after conqueror Westeros he married one important highborn woman from every region. Do keep in mind that this was offered in canon but he refused.

But lets say he, and all his descendents, do and the dragons can still be bound to his dynasty. How does this change the way the continent and the series plays out?

On another note I always found it weird that GRRM didn't delve into polgyny has much as he should have given the setting and it feels out of place many times. I mean https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France#Personal_life was said to have nearly seventy illegetimate and legitimate children.

I guess one of the major problems with this is that Westeros will now be following the Open Succession method that most muslim realms did back in the middle ages. This is basically for trading for long term peace there's almost always a succession crisis or war after a monarch dies. Another issue may be trying to wipe out the Faith of Seven or for a reformation. 

Finally if we go to present day things (e.g. Robert Baratheon), things get really difficult. He'd basically have his hands full killing the descendants of all the Targaeryans and that's not including if he followed said custom."	1570965791.0

So. The Night King was killed by Arya Stark (please btw not to get into opinions either way on that detail, it's simply the show's canon now)

which she absolutely would not have been able to get to do if Beric Dondarrion hadn't just saved her from certain death (to be fair, with a solid assist from the Hound) only moments before

which he absolutely would not have been able to do if, counting backwards now past the last 5 repeats, he himself hadn't been literally resurrected from death back to life all those years ago the very first time by someone who was only merely attempting to invoke the hail mary-level possibility for no greater or more complicated reason than he was going to miss his good friend too much for his heart to bear, Thoros of Myr. A chain of events began for the purest, sweetest reason there could pretty much be. Plus, Thoros (along with Beric and the other men) only even got to the position to initially meet Arya Stark at all because he had failed at his originally intended task of converting King Robert to the Lord of Light.

Granted, I do say all of this kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it's a solid line of cause & affect. and sure, one might say the Lord of Light did the heavy lifting, but, first of all... fuck 'em! (as Davos laments in 8x04 ""we fight and win his war, and he fucks off without any word of thanks or explanation"") And it was still Thoros who takes the first step, out of sheer desperation. I'm guessing it's significantly harder and much less likely for a fresh corpse to just pop back up without the red tape getting done by the normies first."	1570946212.0

You'd think they'd find a lot in common and much to admire in each other.

* Both were essentially exiled after the deaths of their fathers, forced to be on the run and at times reduced to begging or similarly awful conditions.
* Both saw an insane amount of evil and suffering and endured as much in spite of their relative youth.
* Both have a strong desire to protect the innocent and the downtrodden and are willing to punish the wicked in extreme ways. Both break the gender mold in that Arya wants to be a badass fighter and Daenerys is something of a warrior princess herself (and wants to be queen in her own right, as opposed to through her husband).
* Arya also loved historical female ''heroes'' such as Nymeria and Aegon's sisters like Visenya Targaryen, who coincidentally is Dany's ancestor. It wouldn't be hard to imagine her being amazed by Dany's dragons too.
* Both love Jon, albeit in different ways lol. Both also happen to be Jon's family, in ways they did not originally know.
* Daenerys RISKED her life and dragons, basically her babies, to save Jon. She in fact lost Viserion trying to do this. You might not like Dany for wanting the North to bend to her (although she stopped asking for the North's fealty at that point and Jon bent to her out of free will), but Arya kinda should acknowledge what Dany did for her brother.
* Even if Arya mistrusts Daenerys, she mistrusted Sandor and Jaqen to some extent too and even Tywin, yet was able to have a working relationship with all three and at least respected the first two to a certain extent. Arya is not an idiot, and if she mistrusts Dany for whatever reason, she should be MORE wiling to get to understand the person she does not trust and learn more about her, not less.
* Arya is not Sansa. Arya does not care about dynastic squabbles. She cares about the Starks because they are her family, but she doesn't care about the restrictive mores of this period. This is the girl who befriended the seemingly low born Gendry, whom she knew as an armorer's apprentice. She broke bread with Lannister soldiers. She, again, respected the historical female Targaryens for their badassery, and Daenerys is one herself but today. Arya is her own person, and shouldn't just blindly okay whatever Sansa says. She didn't do that for Ned, why her sister?
* This is all, of course, ignoring the bullshit that was S8."	1570897569.0

In fact, Tywin hated him since birth to the point he wanted to carry Tyrion to the sea and let him drown. However, he let the boy live because he was a Lannister.

Which brings me to my question - why is Tyrion named Tyrion? It's intriguing that just as how Tywin and Tytos's names begin with the 'Ty' part, so does Tyrion. We also know there were past Tyrion Lannisters at least in the book, one of them was apparently a disgusting psychopath (known as the 'Tormentor' for his habit of making women bleed) but the others were more or less okay and relatively well-respected individuals. You'd think Tywin, who DEEPLY hates his youngest son, would shun naming him in the 'Ty' style when he didn't even name his more beloved children according to that pattern. Yet that's not what happened, and his hated son is the one whose name is most classically Lannister like.

In contrast, Jaime and Cersei seem to have very original names that never appear earlier in the Lannister lineage. Is there something more to this weird naming trend, or am I looking too much into it?"	1570686588.0

[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones characters according to an AI	4	dg072t	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dg072t/spoilers_game_of_thrones_characters_according_to/	2	"I was playing around with this AI called Talk to Transformer (https://talktotransformer.com/), which is trained on billions of web pages of text. I decided to enter Jon Snow to see what it would produce. The result was amusing so I followed with some others (retrying a few times to get something good), and here they are:

**Jon Snow**

>Jon Snow (Red Viper) Character Information: Red Viper Character Profile: Red Viper is a famous ""Wildling hero of the Seven Kingdoms"" who led an army against the Boltons during the Stark Rebellion. He is a former king, son of a Tyrell family squire, and also the cousin of Tyrion Lannister, making him one of the first-born sons of Lannister royalty. He was last seen during A Dance with Dragons , and has been portrayed in one of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books. Jon Snow (Red Viper, as seen in A Dance with Dragons ) is currently residing at Winterfell. According to George R.R. Martin in A Storm of Swords, his father was the Hand of the King when he ascended to a seat of power and was known as The Lion of Winterfell.

**Arya Stark**
>Arya Stark (Dany's cousin) is a powerful character, much like Theon Greyjoy's, who wields much power (and power-related slang) such as: the dragon, the power sword, the dragon, soul-snatching, the secret door, power-saving, a power sword? One might think of her as a dragon, and one might not, depending on whether one's eyes are open or closed as one's mind drifts into the realm of the mystical or one's mind drifts deeper into what might be the world of demons. Either way, she wields a power sword which is almost always described with her name (though in the latter, we may be misremembering what it is, since the phrase in question does not seem to have been recorded until the early to mid 19th century).

**Sansa Stark**
>Sansa Stark, a.k.a. ""Sansa, the Lost Girl,"" who has also been on our wish list for years, is back in another new role. She makes a very small appearance during a flashback, during which she talks to Benjen about his past, and we also learn there is something happening at the Wall with the Blackfish and Jon Snow. The scene is a quick glimpse at what to expect from Sansa's character ‚Äì and it's not the first time the TV series has dealt with her in the flashbacks. She first appeared in Season 8's ""Hardhome,"" which revealed that she had been captured by the Faceless Men before being rescued by Daenerys. She returned in Season 9's ""Battle of the Bastards,"" when she helped Jon get his arms back after they were stolen by the Night King. In Season 10, she played a minor role in the climactic battle with the White Walkers.

**Tyrion Lannister**
>Tyrion Lannister  is not only a fan of the show, he's also a big Game of Thrones fan himself; he even appeared in a  Season 6 episode  as a character called ""Tyrion the Brave"". As you can see, he was wearing a Lannister outfit, and a Lannister battle suit. As I said before,  Sansa Stark  played the main character of the season 6, and even though she had a Lannister accent, she wasn't really a Lannister. That's probably why we were given more characters with Lannister accents (e.g. Jaime Lannister), not to mention the many other characters who actually know a Lannister accent, like Brienne of Tarth  and Littlefinger (aka Melisandre). The main reason I'm talking about this scene is that if you think about it, it could be used as a kind of subversion of the ""Game of Thrones"" TV Series. In  season 2,  Arya Stark  was a real person and a character from her own story.

**Cersei Lannister**
>Cersei Lannister  wound up being shot in the abdomen by Jaime while her sister Margaery suffered a severe burn. Both sisters have the scars and the scars of their wounds have become a part of both their characters. In one scene Jaime takes the blame for Cersei's wounds and Cersei is furious. Cersei says that Jaime is the reason her wounds were so bad because he thought someone else would be blamed too and he should be punished. She is angry and hurt that she feels wronged when someone else should have been blamed. In another scenes she is upset and upset when her sister Margaery's hand is cut. She is upset that she feels that she was not in control and could have seen it happening and is upset that they will not admit fault even though neither character will be getting any sympathy. She is also upset that Cersei will not be able to go to King's Landing as a result and will not have a home in this world because of having to stay back in Winterfell with her sister's wounds. 

**Jaime Lanniser**
>The first person Jaime meets at Winterfell is Lord Eddard Stark. Jaime was a Stark from the Free Cities, he served at the Wall for one season and then left him on the tourney grounds to fend for himself. Now he has been taken captive by Cersei Lannister's Lannister soldiers and will soon be beheaded if he doesn't surrender on his wedding night. Eddard Stark is a loyal Stark and a great warrior. He holds no grudge against Jaime, though he is aware of Jaime's true allegiances and wishes to end the war and bring order to the Seven Kingdoms. Eddard Stark was born a Stark, so he is a major Stark character, and I think is the Stark character the fans (especially those that watch the show) most relate to. After Jaime and Cersei make their first appearance we see the two standing at a table holding a banner which says ""All of Westeros - Welcome to Winterfell"". Eddard Stark takes up the banner and joins in the Battle of the Fist of the First Men, winning.

**Ned Stark**
>Ned Stark  said that he had the ability to create a shield from air, but it never happens.  The only other time he uses this ability is when he was in his cave looking for the dragons.

**Hodor**
>Hodor  is the central character of this work; and though he has three sons from a marriage to Tanya, Hodor is by far the most popular. In the novel, it is in no small part in reference to him and how he was treated by his father that the book was made a movie, a feature that has been repeated across the centuries.
The book starts as an early version of our present day, with Hodgins' sister Yara, Horkan's son, playing a series of pranks on the family of the same name and their servant, in order to distract them from the discovery of a tomb at Belz. A couple of years later, Hodgins begins to suspect that he has an adopted son, the one whom his father sent him to protect, who he can't quite remember. The family is living a life of luxury and convenience at a small hilltop estate, and they all seem to get fatter, but Hodgins finds he cannot enjoy himself.

**Joffrey**
>Joffrey Baratheon  has been dead for three years.  And if you're going to claim that he's an innocent man as well as a hero then how about you admit that he died trying to get someone to care? I'll wager that the average Baratheon in the Seven Kingdoms, who have to deal with a constant stream of lies and falsehoods, is the least sympathetic character in the Westeros universe. It's really, really hard to take Joffrey Baratheon seriously if you're not a fan of Game of Thrones.  Not only does he have the personality of a fucking slavering lizard, he's also been the victim of a thousand petty murders in his life and a thousand more petty betrayals.
And yet, Joffrey's death has not slowed him down and he's going to be out there doing all the things we love as a fan of the show: bullying his way to the top of House Baratheon and his love interest, Myrcella Baratheon; plotting against the king and his wife; and of course, the ultimate battle."	1570752390.0

You'd think him doing it to Craster's kids would serve as foreshadowing of some sort, but that was very much NOT the case. Imagine the NK turning our heroes' allies and friends into White Walkers, as opposed to brainless wights. It would make for intense emotional drama and also help make the NK a threat in his own right outside of his ability to control others. Also imagine the NK's goal was in fact to convert someone else to his form (a new NK or even NQ) so he can become human again.

Imagine if the NK turned Daenerys into the new Night Queen instead, to take advantage of her stronger connection to Wight-Viserion, and fought Jon on land while Night Queen Dany and Wight-Viserion face off against Rheagal and a Bran-controlled Drogon. Jon would not want to kill Daenerys as he'd suspect she's still in there somewhere, which would make the battle MUCH harder not only physically but also emotionally for the good guys."	1570697803.0

My prediction is that Jon and Dany will have to give up their baby in a pact with the White Walkers. Melisandre has pointed out that prophecies are a tricky thing and the show has always foreshadowed that they are often partly interpreted an example would be ‚ÄúThe Prince/Princess(High Valeryian) That Was Promised‚Äù.My thoughts are that this part of the prophecy wasn‚Äôt interpreted fully and that the full interpretation should roughly have been ‚Äúthe prince that was promised(sacrificed) to the lord of Light or to the Others(white walkers in the books) to save humanity‚Äù. The show has been foreshadowing the sacrificing of children  for the ‚Äògreater good‚Äô and ‚Äòsurvival‚Äô for a long time eg Kraster sacrificing his sons to not be harmed eg Stannis sacrificing Shereen for the snow to melt and many other eg The Witch sacrificing Dany‚Äôs unborn child(only death can pay for life and she wasn‚Äôt talking about the horse) to keep Drogo ‚Äòalive‚Äô.Its been a constant theme in the series. Which brings us to the one of the biggest hints in the show has ever given us. The story of Ned Stark ‚Äòdefeating‚Äô Sir Arther Dayne. It shows that stories of past glory often need to be taken with a pinch of salt. The way Arther Dayne was defeated was dishonorable(stabbed in the back by Howland Reed) so in order to cover it up Ned chose to tell a glorious story of how he defeated him head on. This brings us to the story of Azor Ahai it is said that in order to create light bringer a weapon that was used to ‚Äòdefeat‚Äô(insert finger quotes here) the white walkers the first time around Azor Ahai had to create a sword and stab the love of his life through the heart in order to temper and cool down the sword,it took him 180 Days to create the final sword that was used(180 days is 6 months,children can be born after 6 months..see where this is going).My theory is that Azor Ahai sacrificed his child to the white walkers and had to stab his wife in order for her to release the child (as she was obviously protesting)to drive back the white walkers. To cover this terrible act up a glorious and heroic story was told( Like the Ned fight at the tower of joy). If the white walkers had been defeated by Azor Ahai they wouldn‚Äôt be troubling the good people of Westeros up to now would they? Everyone has been wondering what their motive is,George RR Martin has described them as not evil and completely bad just misunderstood. My thoughts are the reason for their attack is simply they are coming for THE PRINCE/PRINCESS THAT WAS PROMISED TO THEM in prophecy! To be their leader maybe ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but who better to be the leader of the White Walkers than a child who possesses magical blood of the Targaryens and the magical blood of the first men. This act of sacrifice is the reason why there must ‚Äòalways be a Stark in Winterfell‚Äô(something that has been needlessly repeated in the show and books so many times), because the Starks(the first men) that have always been there(before Bran the Builder put up the Wall) knew the true dishonorable act of how the white walkers were driven back the first time they attacked and the sacrifice that needed to be made and have always passed down this dark secret from generation to generation but now the secret got lost over the years .Now let‚Äôs bring it home! Melisandre‚Äôs prophecies have not been incorrect,what has been incorrect is the way she‚Äôs interpreted them the person she‚Äôs seen who she thought was Stannis leading the war against the dead and bringing some kind of peace and win was in fact Jon and how his child(Lightbringer) will be used in a pact to drive the White Walkers back cause let‚Äôs be honest even with 2 Dragons and all those armies there‚Äôs no chance in hell they are winning that fight. The witch that curses Dany when her child was sacrificed  for Drogo did say ‚Äúwhen your womb quickens again and you bear a living child,then he will return and not before‚Äù she wasn‚Äôt talking about Drogo!
This would be the bittersweet ending that they promised"	1570725400.0

[SPOILERS] Theory on the Iron Bank and plot inconsistencies	4	df8igd	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/df8igd/spoilers_theory_on_the_iron_bank_and_plot/	5	"After the massive amount of plot holes from the final season, I desperately tried to make sense of the strange conclusion to the story that had engrossed me for years. One major plot hole that I couldn't understand was the troop numbers at the battle for Kings Landing and the subsequent burning of the city. I believe that I have created a solid bit of lore friendly head Canon that I will hope turns out true and I wanna share.

After the Battle of the Long Night, we saw Dany get absolutely decimated as far as her armies were concerned. The Dothraki took the worst beating, and we don't see them again that episode after their lights go out. The Unsullied also suffered heavy losses. However, after that episode, they have a strategy meeting where they say that they have half of each force as far as manpower goes. How is that possible?  One answer: The Iron Bank.

After Cercei pays off her debt to the bank and hires the Golden Company, the viewer is led to believe that the bank is backing her claim to the throne. There is an issue though. With the old debts payed off, the bank will not have as much power over the crown that it once did.  Also, they would be putting all their eggs in one basket against the Breaker of Chains, who brought Slavers Bay to heel. If Dany won, what would stop her from sacking Braavos next? Any shrewd banker knows that you have to hedge your bets. 

How do you keep the Targaryen girl in line? You put her in debt. 

What she really needs are boots on the ground, and she seems to like using the Unsullied and Dothraki. There are far more Unsullied than what Dany liberated. They have been bought and sold for over 3000 years. All the major cities of Slavers Bay have their own Unsullied troups. It wouldnt be so hard for the Bank to aquire a fair sized chunk of them and ship em over the sea. Then comes the Dothraki. Did you know there are already Dothraki in the Seven Kigdoms prior to Dany & company? There are some that ride with the Bloody Mummers as well as other groups. These men would gladly ride for anyone for the right price, so acquireing them is fairly straightforward. There was also a strong Northern presence at the battle. There were several houses that did not heed Jon's call when he tried to reinforce winterfell from the incoming Night King. I'm sure these houses had some northern men that the Iron Bank could lean on them to donate. This Also explains why the one northern soldier during the battle Attacked Jon and how they did not listen to him. There was no real loyalty there. 

So we got the army, what do they ask of Dany?  Please burn the city to the ground. Rebuilding a city would cost an extraordinary amount of gold. Who better to help finance the rebuilding than the Bank? It would ensure the crowns debt and it's subservience for the next 100 years. Plus, if she doesn't do it, just have the new troops turn on her closest friends. Dany was forced to do this, as it was the only way for her to win.

So, the Golden Company. Why did they perform so awful? Even Euron Grejoy remarked on how pitiful they were after he easily murdered two of these 'top notch' mercs on the ride over. They brought no elephants, and seemed only practiced in marching formation. I believe that this was a token army, not the actual Golden Company. The Golden Company has an awesome track record, and is the favorite force of the Iron Bank to use when it needs military muscle. Why would they let Cercei have such an asset for such a risky proposition? What Cercei got, was a gaggle of slaves in shiny armor. 

In the end, the bank always wins. If Dany wins, then they can say 'look how helpful I am and btw you owe me'. If Cercei got lucky? 'we knew we'd back the rightful queen... How are you planning on rebuilding the Lannister army?'.

First of all I wanna clarify, I'm not saying this in a pervy mode, I'm legitimately curious about it, let me explain myself

The show never backed down on nudity as we all obviously know at this point, it even went to ridiculous lengths to show unneeded nudity, and it didn't back down Daenerys doing it, with Missandei, etc

Sophie Turner was underage in the first season(s?) I get it, but so was Maisie Williams, and even she got nude at one point, tho not as explicitly as other cast members but it still happened

But the show seemed to go out of its way to ""censor"" Sansa's scenes, it didn't have any problem with Showing Khal Drogo raping Dany, with Ramsay it is cut and the witnesse's reaction

It shows Dany bathing bare chested for the lulz but it does face shots when Sansa is bathing 

It shows a *way younger* cast member, Maisie sorta getting naked, but never Sansa

Again, I'm not asking as a pervert, I'm literally curious if it was policies or contract or what, because for a show as explicit as this, it specifically worked to avoid any Sansa nudity scenes, but went out of its way to show some nudity in our faces from other cast members or extras"	1570534407.0

How could House Tyrell let him fight the Mountain and possible die as the only heir to Highgarden. 

His luck was that Ser Gregor lost during the fight but even after that he wanted to kill him and probably would have if Sandor didn‚Äôt intervene ( like with that previous Ser).
I think the Mountain as the main blood-thirsty psychopath of the show wanted to kill him too.

How could the Lannisters ( especially Tywin) and Robert risk this?

I just got this thought because I remember how Oberyn volunteered for the trial by combat and after his death how the Martells wanted to avenge it. 
And even Olenna how grieved for her grandchildren.

[Spoilers] Did Jon really deserve to be King in the North?	2	debjqn	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/debjqn/spoilers_did_jon_really_deserve_to_be_king_in_the/	72	"If you ask me, Jon didn't really deserve to be King in the North. He sucked as a leader, and here's why.

If not for the knights of the Vale, who were loyal to Sansa (Sansa, *not Littlefinger*, as many people tend to ignore or forget), Jon and his forces would've been wiped out by Ramsay's forces. While individually he did pretty well in combat (killing like twenty good men in the skirmish and defeating the Bastard of Bolton himself), he did a piss poor job of actually leading his men. He would've been killed in the first cavalry rush by Ramsay if his didn't save him first, and that too because he broke formation out of rage at losing Rickon - which, while completely understandable, still cost him. Fighting bravely is good and all, but that in itself does not make a King.

He didn't even think of arming Wun Wun with, say, a tree or some sort of makeshift armor - either of which would've made him much more dangerous in battle and allowed him to take out a lot of soldiers with one swing. I don't even think Ghost, a direwolf who is completely capable of taking on grown and armed fighters, was involved. There was no real strategy from Jon other than the one that wouldn't have won him the war anyway, and the one he deviated from.

At least when Robb was KITN, he did a *far* better job. He beat the Lannisters, led by men the size of Tywin and Jaime, THREE times over. He captured the Kingslayer in one of these battles. He tricked Tywin into squandering his numerical advantage. Even the proud lord of Lannister acknowledged Robb and believed he would not fail unless they resorted to dirty tricks such as collaborating with the Boltons and Freys to murder the Starks at a wedding. The guy also put people like Greatjon Umber in their place, whereas neither Jon nor Sansa could successfully do likewise to the Northerners THEY dealt with. In fact, Jon literally just forgives the Northerners who didn't join him against Ramsay. Robb would NOT do that.

Robb actually strategized. We see him dispense justice to traitorous lords and put others in their place. We see him defeat an extremely powerful army and much more skilled generals. He not only fights but also leads. He inspired respect in the vast majority of Northerners under his cause and used his authority well. He makes sacrifices and actually feels the weight of them, the lives he sacrificed and lost. Even killing Rickard Karstark wasn't that bad considering that the guy deserved it and that Robb had to ensure the Lannisters would not kill any prisoners they had either.

Then let's talk about how Jon dealt with Daenerys. First of all, he made a stupid decision just going to Dany totally empty-handed. He was supposed to go there and mine dragonglass, yet he didn't even mention this to the dragon queen until Tyrion, HER hand, prompted him to do so. Secondly, instead of offering Dany SOME kind of deal in exchange for the Northerners' independence (something Yara of the Ironborn did), he bluntly said ''no, we'll be independent, period lol''.

He could've offered to marry her, or support her in taking the rest of Westeros back, or something. Political marriages are a literal thing in this landscape, something even Robb acknowledged and had Edmure participate in when he could not do so. Daenerys even let Yara have independence in exchange for getting the Iron Fleet - pretty sure Jon, if he tried to be more reasonable and play to Dany's sympathies, could've gotten a similar deal for the North. To make things worse, when Dany DOES realize that she needs to fight the Night King and stops asking him to ''bend the knee'', Jon then goes...and bends the knee, unnecessarily throwing away Northern independence. That was a terrible decision - completely disrespectful of his people, none of who wanted to bow to Southron rule any more.

At least he should've talked about this with them first. At this point, Dany didn't ***need*** him to bend the knee any more. He could've easily married her to symbolically seal ties between her and the North, if he loved her. This way he can be with her, and let Sansa be QITN instead. Everyone would've been happy - Jon, Dany, Sansa, and the rest of the North. No more political infighting. But no, Jon just had to bend the knee...out of love. Who cares what his own people think.

Not saying Sansa deserved to be QITN either, though I do think she deserved it - but that's another story."	1570434921.0

[SPOILERS]Who else felt bad of how the night king/white walkers, dragons and overall magic themes were treated in the show?	0	ddylj6	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ddylj6/spoilerswho_else_felt_bad_of_how_the_night/	39	"Cause I do, that is my overall problem not just with season 8 but the entire show, literally the white walkers were set up as the ultimate enemy for 8 seasons just to die and by aryas hand. And no, im not upset cause a girl killed them, anyone could have killed them and id be mad, i was in the minority who actually wanted the white walkers to win. It was also more of how they died was especially insulting and then I had to be kept telling how this was the greatest fantasy if not greatest drama on tv. And the dragons were basically wasted, I understood sadly the one dragon(the one the night king killed) became a white walker dragon and had to die but there was no reason to kill that other dragon imo rhaegal i think his name was. And the last one drogon got a horrible end cause his mom died and he left and is alone, possibly the last dragon on earth and im afraid the humans were going to hunt him down and kill him.

The overall magic themes were done very poorly in the show overall and it angered me when people said this is the greatest fantasy drama, if you want to claim its the greatest human drama, that is fine but they poorly did the magic elements. I would have at least redeemed the white walkers and kept all the dragons alive cause of how so little the magic elements are. That is why I am not super excited for the upcoming prequels cause they are prequels, anything magic in it be a creature or a magic spell will either be destroyed or go into obscurity cause they wont make it to the main show except the white walkers and the original 3 eyed raven.

Basically I just hope I wasnt in the minority when the white walkers lost, while everyone else on social media was cheering for it, I was basically on the inside crying cause for a magic creature like that to have an impact the way they did on a true adult channel was rare, true blood wasnt good enough and I thought game of thrones would do it better, clearly I was wrong. Maybe there is an alternate ending/scene in the game of thrones season 8 dvd but it doesnt matter cause it isnt canon, its basically fan fiction."	1570365029.0

[Spoilers] The problem with Bran being king narrative wise	12	dcrinw	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dcrinw/spoilers_the_problem_with_bran_being_king/	12	There have been a lot of thoughts given on why Bran becoming king in the way he did was utterly ridiculous and felt unearned. I myself have shared a lot of the same feelings but it wasn't until rewatching the last council scene that it dawned on what the real problem is. He leaves the small council to go find Drogon and let them run the country. So he doesn't have any real interest in ruling and instead leaves it to the council to do it. You know who that sounds similar to...‚Ä¶. Robert Baratheon! It hit me like a lightning bolt but the story has gone back to square one with a king who doesn't have any real interest in running the country which is how this whole mess got started in the first place. So after all the misery, Westeros has gone through they get stuck right back where everything was in season 1 and nothing has truly changed. Which is horrible storytelling and why it causes such a problem narrative wise	1570141069.0

Also the parallel to the each of the women's mixed feelings about Jon. Both love him, yet they have conflicting agendas that may cause them to kill him. Ygritte with her loyalty to the Wildlings and Dany's drive to be the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms."	1570146518.0

I like the cinematography. I like how they both stood their ground. I like the historical references.

It ends with the same score as ""the feast scene"" in ""The Last of the Starks"" - the ominous version of Dany's theme since there is also a complicated ""clash of interests"". It was there from their very first scene together.

It just seems to be so long ago.

I would also like to point out that season 7 Dany is the best looking Dany. She was just missing a crown with a dragon motive.

That's it. That's the post.

Both these are fiction based on history and I thought they would scratch the itch of waiting for the latest GOT season. Unfortunately both failed to come close and just left me disappointed... although Vikings has its moments I gave up after season 2. Recently I tried to get into HBO's Rome which should of been right up my alley. It's more historically accurate than the others and the story was really interesting but I just find myself getting bored with it and comparing it to GOT all the time. One of the reasons I think it's because the production value on GOT is so high you barely notice your watching a TV show and you get drawn into the world whereas on other shows it just looks like actors dressing up. Has this happened to anyone else? Will any historical drama live up to the excitement and brilliant story of thrones?	1570052748.0

[Spoilers] Does anyone else believe Syrio Forel was Jaqen H'Ghar?	16	dbha7n	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dbha7n/spoilers_does_anyone_else_believe_syrio_forel_was/	23	"Old theory, I know, but after remembering the fact that we never actually saw Syrio die at the hands of Meryn Trant and his fellow scumbags and how Jaqen H'Ghar mysteriously appeared as a prisoner being taken into custody, it's definitely possible. I mean, first of all, Syrio truly was a badass swordsman (definitely good enough for Ned to hire him as Arya's tutor, which says a lot considering that Ned himself is no slouch in combat) - he was clearly holding his ground against Trant and his fellow swordsmen with just a wooden stick, and at no point did it look like he was at a disadvantage.

Though Trant is of the Kingsguard, he's clearly more of a political appointee and his actual skills are mocked by Sandor Clegane and Bronn both (both of who know him well). In reality, he's just a sadistic thug who can do little more than beat up helpless little girls. There's no way he could beat Syrio in a proper fight, especially if Syrio disarms one of the other Lannister men and uses his (actual) sword instead of a wooden stick. My hypothesis is that Forel took out Trant's entire group but spared their lives as he didn't have their names (which is a big deal for Jaqen). This way, he could still keep Arya safe but also adhere to the rules of the House of Many Faces. Something like actually dying or faking his death is far less likely in comparison, he'd have no reason to do the latter and he absolutely has no reason to lose to those punks.

As for how he got captured...I believe Syrio, who was really Jaqen, simply LET himself get captured by Lannister soldiers on purpose so he could get close to Arya again and continue teaching as well as protecting her. At least in the show, it's clear he genuinely liked Arya and wanted to help her achieve her potential, even letting her leave in S6 after killing the Waif.  As for other supporting evidence, I think it's not a coincidence that both dudes are from Braavos, both had a direct hand in training the girl to be a better fighter and killer, both have a genuine attachment to her (to the point that Jaqen, who would otherwise be a total stranger if he wasn't Syrio, looked out for Arya from the start), and realistically speaking NEITHER would ever lose to someone like Meryn Trant who'd get wrecked by a boy whore with a sword.

P.S. Both also have the same religion, which makes the connection even stronger. I'm sure I may have missed something. It's worth pointing out that this may not be the case in the books where Syrio really might have died (though again I doubt it), but as far as the show is concerned, Syrio and Jaqen are the same to me.

TLDR: Syrio Forel is Jaqen H'ghar. He defeated Meryn Trant and Trant's minions, as he's a master swordsman good enough to be recognized and hired by Eddard Stark whereas those dudes are all losers. He was already owning them in combat when he let Arya escape, but did not kill them because he didn't have their names. This is a Jqen H'ghar personality trait. He then let himself get arrested (again, something H'ghar would likely never suffer just like that) so he can continue teaching Arya, whom he took an interest in and even grew to care for. He has the same religion, same home of Braavos, and knows exactly who the girl was."	1569902336.0

When was that mission assignment to her? Cause never *once* did Mel ever say anything about ice and fire (until she did)?

Why does the LoL believe Stannis is the PtwP for such a ridiculously long amount of time? Especially when ice and fire hold so much importance, and why is Mel the only priest or priestess who is actively trying to guide the major players (with one ""player"" - whom she focused most of her energy towards - who isn't actually a player at all??)? Yes, Quaithe plays a larger role in the books, but why isn't she a close advisor to Dany as Mel is to Stannis, when Dany plays such in integral part? And what about ice? You send Mel to Stannis, **who, again, is obviously not the ice in the equation**, while having *no other* priests(esses) search for the ice?

There is ample proof that the LoL is real, so why does it take so long for him/it to get his/it's shit together??

One of the biggest criticisms slung season 8's way is the fact that Tyrion is the biggest moron in the room. Either because he told Varys about Jon, or withheld the information about the secret passage behind the Red Keep from Dany, making the whole conflict of the last two seasons feel pointless. 

I can't help but feel those who feel this way are missing the larger picture. Of course Dany could have easily won if she torched the Red Keep from the word ""go."" But it was stated in 'Stormborn' by Tyrion that the goal is to win Westeros, not the throne. That means the people, and not filling them with terror that will only cause the same resistance Dany met in Slaver's Bay. 

I won't say that Tyrion was a genius but he was a changed man from the miserable state he was in as a result of the final straw that was his mock trial. He wanted to helo her make the world a better place, even if it meant forging hairbrained schemes at the last minute like having Jaime convince Cersei to surrender. 

Also Tyrion told Varys about Jon because he was the Master of Whispers and figured he wouls best know how to deal with information that could put their queen in jeopardy. Tyrion didn't consider that Varys would turn traitor"	1569818150.0

[Spoilers] How many boars could Robert take in his prime?	4	daoo9n	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/daoo9n/spoilers_how_many_boars_could_robert_take_in_his/	5	"When Robert Baratheon met his death against the Great Boar, to say he was well past his prime would be putting it mildly. The man was obese from years, if not decades, of overeating and drinking. He hadn't fought anyone in years, as he himself pointed out. Not to mention, he was even more intoxicated than usual, due to drinking extra extra strong-wine that Lancel had prepared for him at Cersei's command. In the end, the boar was able to do to King Robert what the Night King failed to do to Jon or Dany - kill a powerful monarch, and in turn cause a massive crisis to overtake the world.

Yet we must not remember that Bobby B did not go gentle into the night, oh no. Bobby B made sure to take the beast down with him, even as rusty as he was due to decades of not fighting, on top of him having let himself go to binge drinking and eating, on top of him being even more intoxicated than usual due to Cersei's evil plots. The beast was then cooked and produced enough meat to seemingly feed Tyrion and Jaime all the way into S4, where the brothers are reunited after a series of events separated them in S1 alone (including the war that the boar had unwittingly caused).

Knowing that the US is about to deal with its own boar invasion from Canada and knowing that Robert in his prime was a beast of a man, how many boars do you think Robert could kill on his own? Assume that he has his war hammer, badass stag helmet, armor, Rheagar-killing rage, glowing eyes, the works, etc... Assume that he will fight 30-50 feral hogs on his own. If that's too unfair to Robert, cut that number in half.

I'm assuming that a non-drunk Robert could at least take 2 boars and possibly 3 on his own without the warhammer. A drunk Robert was able to kill one, even at the cost of his own life, after all, and a non-drunk version could well take 2 or 3 at the cost of his life. With his trusty warhammer, he could take up to 5 - he'd be a lot stronger with it.  In his prime, he'd be WAY faster and stronger, so he'd probably take at least 10 without armor, and probably more with armor (which would help him survive attacks)."	1569748508.0

[Spoilers] Rambling Thoughts on Cersei's Character Arc	5	d9nzu7	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d9nzu7/spoilers_rambling_thoughts_on_cerseis_character/	20	"Something that really bugged me in season 8 was how Cersei was handled. As a character she has had a very excellent character arc among the ""villain"" characters in the story. She starts off as a powerless but vindictive woman who basically lives in fear and resentment. We don't see her take real action to actually do something strategic until she kills King Robert. This is done through a proxy of course so she does not truly get her hands dirty. In fact her unwillingness to really sully her hands herself is a big part of all her schemes.

But as the series progresses she gets bolder, and bolder in the lengths she is willing to go in order to protect her children and grasp power. After 5 seasons of using proxies and behind the scenes schemes, we see her fully come into her own in the season 6 finale. Her plan to simply blow up her enemies and declare herself Queen of the 7 Kingdoms is a big turning point. She's done hiding, she'd done relying on behind the scenes plots and secret schemes and using others to gain power or ruling through people. It's her game now. Even in season 7 this character growth continues as she has no issue openly sleeping with Jaime, and even manages to finally outsmart Tyrion who has always been a step ahead.

All of this is thrown away in season 8. We again see a character who is passive, relying on someone else to do her dirty work. This woman who has spent so much of the series rising to her own power, stepping over countless corpses to get there mostly stares out a window for season 8, has few great scenes of her own and when the final battle with Daenerys comes to King's Landing, much to my own surprise, her only plan is to shoot Dany with the scorpions. Like that's it? Your relying on Euron alone to do this? No other plans of tricks up your sleeves? Just seemed very regressive and very out of character for her and was one of my most disliked aspects of the season.

Idk, maybe i'm totally misreading things but it's just something I wanted to get off my chest that plagues my mind whenever I think of the series."	1569552601.0
[No Spoilers] Ranking Peter Dinklage Emmy's submissions over the years	5	d9mdms	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d9mdms/no_spoilers_ranking_peter_dinklage_emmys/	3	"Made this list because I was a bit tired of the spread feeling that he shouldn't have won for ""The Iron Throne"" because he had no material according to some people.

1. The Laws of Gods and Men. It contains his best scene in the show, both for his character and for the actor himself. Didn't win because of a great performance by Aaron Paul and last season of BB.

2. Blackwater. The favorite episode of every Tyrion fan and Tyrion at his best.

3.THE IRON THRONE. Yes, in this episode Dinklage totally shines. Crying scenes, defiant looks, profound speeches and comic moments.

4.The Dragon and the Wolf. That scene with Cersei was enough for the Emmy. Peter had only one episode with worthy material, he chose it, he won. At the Emmys one episode is enough.

5.Baelor. The soft side of Tyrion comes out. Dinklage had limited screentime if compared to the previous choices, a true episode for a supporting actor, but the character was so groundbreaking that he was on everyone's mouth in 2011. And he deservedly won.

6.Second sons. He didn't have lots to do in season 3 honestly, but again this episode showcases his talent. Angry glares to Joffrey and his father and an over-the-top drunk behaviour that we will never see again in Tyrion.

7.Hardhome. Two great scenes with Emilia Clarke. And that's it. Dinklage had little screentime all spread out in season 5, less than 10 minutes per episode generally. And this was certainly a make up win for the previous year.

8.No One. Season six is the least interesting season for Tyrion. The only important events were his scene with the dragons and the Hand appointment. But in that episode he still shows range and he got nominated for it.

As you can see, his wins for season 8 and 7 are actually quite high, because acting wise, they're really strong episodes."	1569545681.0

I still believe, that the Night King was the good guy in the story, and the 'good guys' supported the real villain, Brandon Stark without their knowledge.

He obviously manipulated the events of history (just think about the history of the Valyrian dagger), that led not only to the creation and death of the Night King (who can be also his pawn without the NK's knowledge), but also resulted his reign. Bran clearly stated, that  it was the only purpose of his travel, therefore he must have been sure what'll happen. And told to Jon and Theon, that they were exactly where they had to be. Just as Arya, Berric Melisandre and Sandor. Therefore, everyone else had to be in the perfect place according to a plan (that also include events like the death of Daenerys).

Bran  had the ability to manipulate the past, therefore he must be able to control the future. Even tho ""The ink is dry"", what happened has already happened or will happen (time can be confusing). But have control over events of the past, present and future.

Everything led to where he is: on the throne. As a King, he is now able to control the present without using his powers.

About the powers of The Lord of Light: I think this is a state he will achieve later, when he ascend to be a 'god'."	1569527891.0

[Spoilers] Tyrion's best speech	4	d9di53	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d9di53/spoilers_tyrions_best_speech/	9	"Here are Tyrion's many speeches, ranked in order of time:

1. Tyrion's ''confession'' at the Vale.
2. Tyrion's speech to the Lannister army at the Battle of Blackwater.
3. Tyrion's trial in King's Landing, where he was falsely accused of murdering Joffrey.

Personally, all three of them were awesome...just in different ways. The Vale confession did a great job showcasing Tyrion's wits and excellent sense of humor (at the expense of others). The Blackwater speech was just super epic and somehow cynical while in a weird way also being inspirational and even noble. The KL speech was both heartbreaking and insanely powerful, where Tyrion finally managed to let out a lot of his pent-up anger and hate at the way people treated him for being a dwarf as well as the way his own family and lover conspired to betray him.

I'd rank them in the following order: 3, 2, and 1. Peter Dinklage did a brilliant job in all three cases, but 3 and 2 speeches literally give me the chills. 3 the speech is so good I can't help rewatching it every now and then.

Which one would you choose?

P.S. You can choose another, if it's not on that list. Even the ''and who has a better story'' speech in S8 :p"	1569494076.0

[SPOILERS] Brandon Stark Theory	3	d8up1n	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d8up1n/spoilers_brandon_stark_theory/	2	"So after GoT finished, I was thinking about Bran Stark because I thought he was based on someone familiar. There was a book that I read recently called ‚ÄòNorse Mythology - Neil Gaiman‚Äô. 

In the book I read about Odin the ‚Äòall-father‚Äô. The book stated that when Odin was in his human form he looked like, ‚Äòa tall man, wearing a cloak and hat‚Äô. 
Now for the more important part of my theory. When Odin is in his human form he normally has two ravens, who fly around the world and report everything to Odin. Therefore he is able to see everything. 

Odin also hung from the world tree for nine days or nine nights, until he fell. This could signify when Bran fell out of the tower in episode one. 

So I believe that George R.R.Martin, may have got some inspiration for Bran via Odin the Norse God."	1569393678.0

I was **really** hoping Bran's destiny would culminate in something evil.

For a messy ending. For Daenarys to KNOW that Jon was gonna try and kill her. For her to get stabbed and for her wound to be cauterised by dragonfire.

For him to solidify not being Bran anymore by,  perhaps, stabbing Jon Snow with dragonglass against the tree. For his  motive to defeat the Night King to be the creation of another stronger  Night King, under his control. One that would give more meaning to the  whole Night King arc.

For everything we thought about a useless  character or the Binary of Lannister vs Stark ""Good vs Evil"" to be  thrown into the trash.

For Daenarys to have a tragic villain arc instead of a random switch flip after the ringing of the surrender bells.

 See: The reason people are disappointed with this season is that it  took all the magic and plot built up from the previous seasons and did a  major disservice to them.

Every character has a Hero's Journey  in them in this series, running simultaneously with multiple characters.  The only thing that can cut these journeys short while still feeling  satisfying is death. And even those need an appropriate amount of weight  to them to feel like it's alright.

Bran  
 Arya  
 Cersei  
 Jaime  
 Tyrion  
 Jon  
 Sansa

Each of these had a journey.

 For Bran, it was his adventure to the North to fulfill his destiny of  becoming the Three-Eyed Raven. What did that culimate into? Well. The  biggest thing he did was tell Jon that he's a Targaryan. Besides that he  went white-eyed during the advance of the Night King. What was SO  IMPORTANT that he was seeing it while death approaches? Idk. We'll never  know. It apparently doesn't matter. 

(Over here, a great insert  would have been to show him warg into Arya and force her into the place  she needs to be to fight the Night King. That'd not only show us Bran  actually being useful, but close the plothole of Arya sneaking through  the dead, and make the whole scene ultimately more satisfying)

 Bran had no motive and no ambitions. After coming back from north of the  wall, he was about as bland a character as you can imagine.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 For Arya, her adventure was to be a female warrior and break free from  the structure that held her down. She succeeded at doing so,  brilliantly. Transitioning from different phases.

From a violent  girl, to a scared but overconfident and ready student, to a scarred  survivor, to a warrior-in-training under The Hound, to a Cold Assassin,  No-One. She then finished her arc by taking out The Night King. With so  short a fight, and the logical lapses, it wasn't as satisfying an ending  to the arc as one would have hoped. So people held out hope that it was  just a fake-out finish and she'll have some ending to her arc that  satisfies them. 

To no avail.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Cersei  had multiple brilliant transformations, the details of which I won't  bother going into. The ratings of episodes before Season 8 kind of speak  for themselves. She was always this sly ruler who you couldn't help but  admire for how she outsmarted everyone. 

Her whole deal was that   
 if opportunityExists:  
Seize\_It();  
  She would amaze us time and time again by always finding a way to come  out on top. Not even trying to show her trying to implement any backup  plan (Despite subtly showing the Greek Fire triggered by the dragonfire  and her Dragon-killing bows) is uncharacteristic of her. Her desperation  and wit was almost absent in the last episode aside from her crying  that she doesn't want to die. She made 0 calls of her own and failed  entirely to even TRY to implement any of her tactics.

(Y'know what they could have written here to both make Daenarys a tragic villain AND make Cersei's death more satisfying?

 For Cersei to order the explosion of the Greek Fire in her last ditch  effort to defeat the northerners, knowing full well that it won't kill  the dragon but still getting one in to go like ""Ha, you can kill me but  I'll bite back till the last moment"", killing almost everyone, and also  making it look like, to the northerners, that it was Daenarys's  dragonfire that triggered the explosion.

This should have  happened after Daenarys stayed true to her nature and bee-lined the Red  Keep and started burning it. If the place is exploding from below,  they'll think Daenarys triggered it cuz fire caused explosions of fire  caches and she was warned against it anyways.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Jaime.

 He fulfilled his plot and tbh I think it's fitting that he died  pathetically at the end. It fulfilled the prophecy, and it really gives  you that bitter realisation that you can't escape fate. That his love  for Cersei was twisted, and even though he knows he's a disgusting  person for having that love, continues to do so.

I don't think he was as wasted this season as the rest.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Tyrion.

 I suppose you can't blame his character for getting nerfed as hard as  he did. He's been calling shots poorly since Season 6. Him failing in  this Season is no big thing. There WAS something missing but I can't  quite put my finger on it. 

His arc was completed seasons ago. I  don't really know what more there is to discuss about him. He could have  literally died for shock value in this season and nothing would have  changed too drastically.

His role in the last episode made absolutely no sense.  
 Everybody just...agreed? That Bran should be King?  
 I doubt anybody besides Sansa and Arya would respect the fact that he's the Three-eyed Raven. Nobody would give a hoot.

Why did anybody care about Tyrion's speech? They should have laughed at it as much as they laughed at that other dude.  
 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Jon.

""She is my queen.""  
 ""She is my queen.""  
 ""She is my Q W E E N.""

\*Sees her burn people and go against his core values\*  
 \*Kills Queen\*

That's about the most predictable plot they could have possibly built up in this season. 

Him being Aegon Targaryen had no impact whatsoever in this entire season besides being a topic of discussion.

 (A nice insert here would be to give that some value in the finale.  Such as his execution being interrupted by Drogon, who breathes fire on  his execution block and him surviving, making it relevant that he's a  Targaryan.)

(Or for him to have died altogether in the finale and  for stuff to go haywire. Everybody expects him to win, and something  HAS to go wrong in the whole season. If Daenarys expected him to try and  kill her, she could have gotten stabbed, grabbed Jon and held the blade  inside her, had Drogon burn her, and walk out of there, the unburnt.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sansa had no role in the finale. She's the only one who acted normal AT ALL in the final debate on who the King should be.

At this point in writing this post, I don't even feel like talking about what could have been different here.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

EDIT:

Rhaegal.

What's impossible is:   
  1 - Not seeing those ships, even if Daenerys is blind, the lookouts on  her ships would have seen them miles away in broad daylight. 

2 -  The angle of those shots, from that far away the angle should be the  same with the spacing of those ships, however the one that pierces  Rhaegals neck comes atleast 40 degress anticlockwise to the others. 

 3 - Hitting with your first attempt shooting at a dragon over 2 miles  away with a subsonic weapon with unpredictable wind between. 

Reminder: They will have had no experience shooting those weapons at aerial moving targets. 

4 - Hitting all three of your shots at said dragon.

 5 - Actually having enough velocity left in the scorpion arrow to  pierce dragon-skin after shooing a couple miles into the air in the open  seas where there must be a tonne of wind.

If we assumed that the  first shot was a super lucky shot, what would have made more sense AND  been more satisfying is for Rhaegal to have descended to a considerable  degree after the first shot, trying to recover and then getting BARRAGED  by scorpion shots.

A believable and satisfying kill."	1569199983.0

[SPOILERS] The biggest mistake the Emmy‚Äôs made was categorizing Game Of Thrones as a Drama rather than a Comedy.	0	d86rsg	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d86rsg/spoilers_the_biggest_mistake_the_emmys_made_was/	3	"I will admit that there were many bleak, dramatic moments to the series. However, I‚Äôve always felt that ASOIAF and GOT were more of a dark satire of the entire High Fantasy genre. This season was definitely a masterpiece of over-the-top setpieces, impending doom, shifting alliances and bittersweet resolutions.

I was thinking of the 1999 film ELECTION, where a pathetic high school teacher becomes involved with a student body presidential election, and how it reminded me of game of thrones. In that film the popular, but dim-witted jock faces the angry, ruthless and ambitious girl for the presidency of a high school. Similarly Jon Snow and Daenerys were both popular and/or ambitious but the logical and intelligent people were mostly relegated to the background. By the end, we have a proper outcome. Bran, the boy who fell...etc., and the wise dwarf were both the better choice for leadership. Tyrion was the cynical but intelligent leader, and Bran was the crippled, cold, efficient but profoundly just ruler. 

The pacing and writing of this season was meant to reflect the chaos and anxiety of supporting these ‚ÄúHeroes‚Äù against the ‚ÄúVillains‚Äù . By the end,  we are left with an intellectually satisfying conclusion rather than a purely emotional one.  

There were definitely some great emotional moments, but like most conflicts, the characters were weary and did not have the energy to muster the political guile that everyone expected from the earlier seasons. It‚Äôs unfortunate too many in the audience didn‚Äôt follow that notion, or were confused by the lack of wit in the dialogue and plotting. There does come a point where the main characters have to face the consequences of their actions, and only the most clever people can sort out the mess they leave behind in the aftermath.  

I do think Benihoff and Weiss were generous to the Jon Snow fans, and actually gave him a more heroic arc than he might receive in GRRM‚Äôs ASOIAF.  He is not burdened by his own charisma, and can spend his days in happiness beyond the wall. I could see Jon Snow becoming a version of coldhands in the books. 

The Dwarf and The Cripple are burdened with leadership, while the strong Hero who would be king rides off into the wintery sunset. That is a snarky and satisfying ending. I do believe this season deserves high recognition, and it would be proper to award season 8 with a best ‚Äúdramedy‚Äù award. The Best Drama of 2019 will have to suffice."	1569275297.0

[SPOILERS] Biggest regret of S8.	8	d7nbti	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d7nbti/spoilers_biggest_regret_of_s8/	27	"Some huge characters had little to no interaction with each other.

Jaime and Dany - yes, they had the ‚Äòtrial‚Äô but a proper one to one would‚Äôve been nice. Jaime explaining why he killed her father, similar to the Brienne bath scene. Perhaps a bit about Cersei.

Cersei and Sansa - this one would be hard to justify but would‚Äôve been nice for Cersei to witness, and perhaps admire, the strong woman Sansa had become.

Cersei and Dany - again difficult but huge rivals with barely any dialogue between them at all.

Arya and Dany - dragons.

Arya and the Lannister‚Äôs - especially Cersei. They‚Äôd always assumed she was dead. 

Jaime and Sansa - bit about Brienne and the oath to her mother.

Jon and Jaime - perhaps a nod to their S1 conversation. 

The Hound and Tyrion/Jaime - about Joffrey.

Sure I‚Äôve missed some and of course it all comes back to how rushed the final season was. The dialogue between the many fascinating characters was a key part of the early seasons, and these reunions/meetings were something I was very much looking forward to. Even the reunions we did get in S8E1 seemed a bit forced or unnatural. Jon had a more emotional reunion with Sansa at Castle Black than he did with Arya at Winterfell, which should never have been the case.

Some of these are hard to justify of course given the geography or the fact at meeting would very likely result in death/major plot diversion (Cersei/Arya), but it was a big frustration of mine from the final season."	1569166584.0

Unlike most people I don't really mind that she did this, but that's not important here.

The NK grabs her throat just the same, makes his cocky smile and kills her by crushing her throat. As the dagger is falling down, Bran wargs into Arya's dead body, her blue eyes open, then grabs the dagger and stabs the NK just like it happened in the show. 

This give the entire Bran story line so much better. Also gives a better ending to Arya. Gets rid of both fan complaints of 1: no main character death in the episode, 2: Arya being the one who kills him, and 3: Bran doing nothing important the entire fight."	1569123122.0

[Spoilers] Need to Vent About this	29	d70bwe	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d70bwe/spoilers_need_to_vent_about_this/	65	"So I am sure this is a dead horse that has been beaten to death a million times over, but I still feel the need to vent. I still cannot get over how this show turned out. I get random stray thoughts on a nearly daily basis on how piss poor this show ended. Perhaps it's because I recently bought some songs from S8 soundtrack that it's really drudging up negative feelings, but it's just such a waste.

If the show had been bad on multiple fronts, things would not feel so empty and unsatisfying, but the music, direction, cinematography, special fx, and acting were at such a peak that if the writing had just been more logical and consistent and not so rushed and forced, we could have had a perfect ending or at least something less boring than what we got.

I still can't believe that possibly the greatest villain I have seen on screen just stood by a window and waited for her useless kept man to secure her victory. That Jon became a mindless parody of himself, that Arya was just a badass plot device, that Tyrion seemingly lost all his cunning and wits, that Jaime totally abandoned a decade of development over the course of one episode, and that Daenerys, went from savior willing to sacrifice her dreams, goals, and even her children for the greater good to Hitler all in one episode and that the development for that heel turn was relegated to a freaking episode recap.

I could write a dissertation on this and I am sure many already have, but it still bothers me how poorly they handled such a great story. Don't think I will ever get closure until I read the Winds of Winter. Just need to vent out my frustration since all my friends and family are really casual fans who while also disappointed, can't really appreciate just how bad this was."	1569038640.0
[SPOILERS] New Alfie Allen interview on Theon, life after GoT.	22	d71d5b	gameofthrones	https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d71d5b/spoilers_new_alfie_allen_interview_on_theon_life/	6	"[New Alfie Allen interview.](https://hauteliving.com/2019/09/alfie-allen-haute-living-cover-story/674100/)

I really enjoyed this read. Alfie has always been one of my favorite actors on this show, so I appreciate his honesty in discussing how the role of Theon affected him - often negatively - at times. He said he stopped reading stuff about his character online after season 2 because it was hard to avoid internalizing the hate for his character. 

I imagine it couldn‚Äôt have been easy with this being his breakout role and all of the massively increased attention and spotlight on him, even having come from a family of actors and growing up among them.

He did a hell of a good job with this show, and I genuinely will be disappointed if he does not win the Emmy he nominated himself for. He killed it from beginning to end.

You‚Äôre a good man.
