As soon as we require paid resources in the main curriculum, we might as well tell people to pay half a million dollars to attend a university. We are an Internet-based community of learners, not a business, so free is the most sensible price and ensures that the only price you need pay is the price of Internet access.*  \\n>  \\n>*At the same time, we recognize that education is scarce resource and therefore requires payment to instructors to make it sustainable in the long term. Therefore, we respect the business model of websites like edX, which make their materials free but with some paid add-ons, like official certificates or extra interaction with course instructors.*  \\n>  \\n>*So we only require that the learning materials of a resource be free to access, not that every possible add-on be free. It would be ideal if graded assignments were always free but if we had this requirement, we would have to exclude any resource that doesn't have graded assignments at all. Plus, there are other ways to get feedback on your work, and OSSU is a do-it-yourself education.*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is on their FAQ page so yes it's free but it's probably not something you can go through really fast and learn unless you've already taken most of these courses.\", \"It'll take you about 1 year to complete the core and an advanced topic if you really do keep a pace of 50hrs/week.\", \"hi sorry for the late reply, i think all the courses are free\\n\\ni'll recommend also : [https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)\", 'Hey!
